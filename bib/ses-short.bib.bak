	abstract = {Mental load and fatigue are important causes of performance decreases and accidents in different activities. However, a robust systematic review, detailing the instruments used to quantify them, is currently lacking. The purpose of this study was to summarize and classify by derivations the validated instruments used to quantify mental load and fatigue. The most representative electronic databases in the scope of this review, {PubMed}, {WOS}, Scopus, {SPORTDiscus}, and {PsycINFO} (until September 2020) were searched for studies that included instruments to analyze mental load and fatigue. The quality of the selected studies was scored using a quality assessment checklist. A total of 40 papers were included. Most of the papers used subjective scales (75\%) to quantify mental load and fatigue, with a small presence of behavioral (n = 5) and objective techniques (n = 5). Less is known about the analysis of mental load and fatigue using a combination of derivations. Despite the high cost and complexity of objective techniques, research that applies these measures is important for further analysis of brain processes in mental load and fatigue. The design of a battery of tests that include the three types of derivations also seems necessary.},

	abstract = {Working memory is typically defined as a system devoted to the simultaneous maintenance and processing of information. However, the interplay between these 2 functions is still a matter of debate in the literature, with views ranging from complete independence to complete dependence. The time-based resource-sharing model assumes that a central bottleneck constrains the 2 functions to alternate in such a way that maintenance activities postpone concurrent processing, with each additional piece of information to be maintained resulting in an additional postponement. Using different kinds of memoranda, we examined in a series of 7 experiments the effect of increasing memory load on different processing tasks. The results reveal that, insofar as attention is needed for maintenance, processing times linearly increase at a rate of about 50 ms per verbal or visuospatial memory item, suggesting a very fast refresh rate in working memory. Our results also show an asymmetry between verbal and spatial information, in that spatial information can solely rely on attention for its maintenance while verbal information can also rely on a domain-specific maintenance mechanism independent from attention. The implications for the functioning of working memory are discussed, with a specific focus on how information is maintained in working memory.

	abstract = {The classic account of the load theory ({LT}) of attention suggests that increasing cognitive load leads to greater processing of task-irrelevant stimuli due to competition for limited executive resource that reduces the ability to actively maintain current processing priorities. Studies testing this hypothesis have yielded widely divergent outcomes. The inconsistent results may, in part, be related to variability in executive capacity ({EC}) and task difficulty across subjects in different studies. Here, we used a cross-modal paradigm to investigate whether augmented working memory ({WM}) load leads to increased early distracter processing, and controlled for the potential confounders of {EC} and task difficulty. Twenty-three young subjects were engaged in a primary visual {WM} task, under high and low load conditions, while instructed to ignore irrelevant auditory stimuli. Demands of the high load condition were individually titrated to make task difficulty comparable across subjects with differing {EC}. Event-related potentials ({ERPs}) were used to measure neural activity in response to stimuli presented in both the task relevant modality (visual) and task-irrelevant modality (auditory). Behavioral results indicate that the load manipulation and titration procedure of the primary visual task were successful. {ERPs} demonstrated that in response to visual target stimuli, there was a load-related increase in the posterior slow wave, an index of sustained attention and effort. Importantly, under high load, there was a decrease of the auditory N1 in response to distracters, a marker of early auditory processing. These results suggest that increased {WM} load is associated with enhanced attentional engagement and protection from distraction in a cross-modal setting, even after controlling for task difficulty and {EC}. Our findings challenge the classic {LT} and offer support for alternative models.},

Viding, see record 2004-17825-003). Here, the authors present new evidence that the type of concurrent working memory load determines whether load impairs selective attention or not. Working memory load was paired with a same/different matching task that required focusing on targets while ignoring distractors. When working memory items shared the same limited-capacity processing mechanisms with targets in the matching task, distractor interference increased. However, when working memory items shared processing with distractors in the matching task, distractor interference decreased, facilitating target selection. A specialized load account is proposed to describe the dissociable effects of working memory load on selective processing depending on whether the load overlaps with targets or with distractors.

Results were analysed and comparisons made between lessons that followed National Literacy Strategy or Numeracy guidelines and those that did not; between schools from different geographical contexts, e.g. rural or inner‐city; between classes where there was one, or more than one, adult present; between schools with different percentages of free school meals; and between a.m. and p.m. lessons. A range of findings included higher rates of students being on‐task than found by previous studies, and correlations between high on‐task rates and teachers who used high levels of verbal behaviour including positive academic feedback. Teachers used three times more verbal approval for desired social behaviour in the classroom than has been reported in previous studies. It was found that teachers verbally interacted more with students during National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy lessons but that this did not lead to statistically significantly higher on‐task rate. Similarly, teachers in inner‐city schools interacted more with students, but on‐task rates in inner‐city schools were not significantly higher. Reasons for this effect are discussed.},

The basic concept was based on more than 50 years of research and the formal theory has endured for 28 years (Locke \& Latham, 1990). The theory was not developed through overgeneralization from only a few studies or by deduction but rather by induction. The inductions involved the integration of hundreds of studies involving thousands of participants. The theory initially focused solely on consciously set goals. To date, the goal setting theory has shown generality across participants, tasks, nationality, goal source, settings, experimental designs, outcome variables, levels of analysis (individual, group, division, and organizational), and time spans. The theory identifies both mediators and moderators of goal effects. Numerous subsequent studies since 1990 have supported the main tenets of the theory. New findings have enlarged our knowledge of the relevant mediators and moderators as well as showing new applications (Locke \& Latham, 2013). Among these discoveries are when to set learning rather than performance goals, the effect of goals primed in the subconscious on job performance, and that goal effects are enhanced by having people write at length about them.

It takes only a minor excursion into human history to realize that the answers to this question have been extraordinarily diverse: some people have pursued sensual pleasure, others have sought love and the joys of intimate relationships. Still others have worked toward the actualization of their potentials, while some have searched for the peace of contemplative spirituality. In spite of the importance of this search, the question of how to define and how to actualize these goals remains one of the most persistent puzzles even today. In spite of the many solutions offered throughout history, the question "What is happiness?" still plagues many people today. Positive psychology is the newest effort to answer that question. Chapter 1 is an introduction to this new focus area of psychology. Chapter 2 reviews basic psychological research on positive emotion and intrinsic motivation. Chapters 3 through 6 cover a number of perspectives that all place a major emphasis on positive emotional states. Chapters 7 through 11 explore research and theory that focus on the development and nurturance of positive traits. The book ends with a final chapter on the future of positive psychology.

To estimate the proportion of healthcare interventions tested within Cochrane Reviews that are effective according to high-quality evidence.
Methods
We selected a random sample of 2,428 (35\%) of all Cochrane Reviews published between 1 January 2008 and 5 March 2021. We extracted data about interventions within these reviews that were compared with placebo, or no treatment, and whose outcome quality was rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation ({GRADE}) system. We calculated the proportion of interventions whose benefits were based on high-quality evidence (defined as having high quality {GRADE} rating for at least one primary outcome, statistically significant positive results, and being judged by review authors as effective. We also calculated the proportion of interventions that suggested harm.
Results
Of 1,567 eligible interventions, 87 (5.6\%) had high-quality evidence supporting their benefits. Harms were measured for 577 (36.8\%) interventions. There was statistically significant evidence for harm in 127 (8.1\%) of these. Our dependence on the reliability of Cochrane author assessments (including their {GRADE} assessments) was the main potential limitation of our study.
Conclusion
More than 9 in 10 healthcare interventions studied within recent Cochrane Reviews are not supported by high-quality evidence, and harms are under-reported.},

	abstract = {Science is a cumulative endeavour as new knowledge is often created in the process of interpreting and combining existing knowledge. This is why literature reviews have long played a decisive role in scholarship. The quality of literature reviews is particularly determined by the literature search process. As Sir Isaac Newton eminently put it: If I can see further, it is because I am standing on the shoulders of giants. Drawing on this metaphor, the goal of writing a literature review is to reconstruct the giant of accumulated knowledge in a specific domain. And in doing so, a literature search represents the fundamental first step that makes up the giant's skeleton and largely determines its reconstruction in the subsequent literature analysis. In this paper, we argue that the process of searching the literature must be comprehensibly described. Only then can readers assess the exhaustiveness of the review and other scholars in the field can more confidently (re)use the results in their own research. We set out to explore the methodological rigour of literature review articles published in ten major information systems ({IS}) journals and show that many of these reviews do not thoroughly document the process of literature search. The results drawn from our analysis lead us to call for more rigour in documenting the literature search process and to present guidelines for crafting a literature review and search in the {IS} domain.},

This makes it hard to keep up with state-of-the-art and to be at the forefront of research, as well as to assess the collective evidence in a particular area of business research. This is why the literature review as a research method is more relevant than ever. Traditional literature reviews often lack thoroughness and rigor and are conducted ad hoc, rather than following a specific methodology. Therefore, questions can be raised about the quality and trustworthiness of these types of reviews. This paper discusses literature review as a methodology for conducting research and offers an overview of different types of reviews, as well as some guidelines to how to both conduct and evaluate a literature review paper.

This paper aims to examine social bots in the context of big data of user-generated content. In particular, the author investigates the scope of information distortion for 24 brands across seven industries. Furthermore, the author studies the mechanisms that make social bots viral. Last, approaches to detecting and preventing malicious bots are recommended. Design/methodology/approach A Twitter data set of 29 million tweets was collected. Latent Dirichlet allocation and word cloud were used to visualize unstructured big data of textual content. Sentiment analysis was used to automatically classify 29 million tweets. A fixed-effects model was run on the final panel data. Findings The findings demonstrate that social bots significantly distort brand-related information across all industries and among all brands under study. Moreover, Twitter social bots are significantly more effective at spreading word of mouth. In addition, social bots use volumes and emotions as major effective mechanisms to influence and manipulate the spread of information about brands. Finally, the bot detection approaches are effective at identifying bots. Research limitations/implications As brand companies use social networks to monitor brand reputation and engage customers, it is critical for them to distinguish true consumer opinions from fake ones which are artificially created by social bots. Originality/value This is the first big data examination of social bots in the context of brand-related user-generated content.},

              Objective
              Except in broad outline, little is known about the most likely symptomatic trajectories in prodromal schizophrenia. The aim of this study is to delineate these pathways.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Taking into account existing clinical knowledge, the causal relationships between the 12 prodrome scales of the
                Schizotypic Syndrome Questionnaire
                ({SSQ}) were examined in a general-population sample by applying the mathematical theory of directed graphs. Use was made of two discovery algorithms implemented in the Tetrad-4 program, as well as of the graphical {DAGitty} program to test whether a particular model holds.
              
            
            
              Results
              A promising model was selected that may describe the causal pathways in schizophrenic prodromal unfolding. Testing this model by means of {DAGitty}, it was shown that the minimal testable implications, listed as conditional independences, and the direct and total effects in the model, identified after correction for bias, were as hypothesized. For practical reasons, a simpler version of the resulting {SSQ} model, containing only its principal pathways, was provided.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Although resembling an earlier model that was based on a series of {LISREL} analyses, the present model was believed to provide a more dependable description of schizophrenic prodromal unfolding, as it relies on methods that are less subject to the limitations involved in {SEM}.},

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

The User Experience Questionnaire ({UEQ}) is one standardized instrument for measuring {UX}. With six scales, it identifies areas in which product improvements will have the highest impact. In this paper, we evaluate the reliability and validity of this questionnaire. The data of N = 1, 121 participants who interacted with one of 23 products indicated an acceptable to good reliability of all scales. The results show, however, that the scales were not independent of each other. Combining perspicuity, efficiency, and dependability to pragmatic aspects as well as novelty and stimulation to hedonic aspects of {UX} improved the model fit significantly. The systematic variations of product properties and correlations with the System Usability Scale ({SUS}) in a second experiment with N=499 participants supported the validity of these two factors. Practical implications of the results are discussed.},

Improving technologies with respect to wellbeing requires nuanced understanding of this impact and reliable ways to measure it. Here, we aim to further this understanding by investigating the relations between psychological needs and people's evaluations of technologies (with respect to satisfaction, usability, and measures of value).{MethodAcross} two studies with 1,521 participants, we improved and validated four scales that were first put forward as part of the {METUX} model of technology interaction. These scales measure psychological needs in the life, behavior, task, and interface spheres of experience. We applied these scales to four separate technologies (Facebook, {TikTok}, Blackboard, and Moodle), and examined the relationships between people's need satisfaction and frustration in the four spheres of experience and their overall evaluations of the technologies.Results and {discussionEach} of the four scales had good psychometric properties across the four technologies. For each sphere of experience, psychological need satisfaction and frustration were associated with standard measures of usability and user satisfaction, and correlation patterns supported the {METUX} model and its approach to differentiating spheres of technology experience.},

	abstract = {The mass adoption of digital technologies raises questions about how they impact people and society. Associations between technology use and negative correlates (e.g., depression and anxiety) remain common. However, pre-registered studies have failed to replicate these findings. Regardless of direction, many designs rely on psychometric scales that claim to define and quantify a construct associated with technology engagement. These often suggest clinical manifestations present as disorders or addictions. Given their importance for research integrity, we consider what these scales might be measuring. Across three studies, we observe that many psychometric scales align with a single, identical construct despite claims they capture something unique. We conclude that many technology measures appear to measure a similar, poorly defined construct that sometimes overlaps with pre-existing measures of well-being. Social scientists should critically consider how they proceed methodologically and conceptually when developing psychometric scales in this domain to ensure research findings sit on solid foundations.},

In addition, the positive subscale reflected societal and personal utility, whereas the negative subscale reflected concerns. The scale showed good psychometric indices and convergent and discriminant validity against existing measures. To cross-validate general attitudes with attitudes towards specific instances of {AI} applications, summaries of tasks accomplished by specific applications of Artificial Intelligence were sourced from newspaper articles. These were rated for comfortableness and perceived capability. Comfortableness with specific applications was a strong predictor of general attitudes as measured by the {GAAIS}, but perceived capability was a weaker predictor. Participants viewed {AI} applications involving big data (e.g. astronomy, law, pharmacology) positively, but viewed applications for tasks involving human judgement, (e.g. medical treatment, psychological counselling) negatively. Applications with a strong ethical dimension led to stronger discomfort than their rated capabilities would predict. The survey data suggested that people held mixed views of {AI}.

In German (N = 367, n = 137 men) and Chinese (N = 879; n = 220 men) online surveys, participants completed items on sociodemographic variables, the Attitudes Towards Artificial Intelligence ({ATAI}) scale, and the Big Five Inventory. Correlational analysis revealed among others significant positive associations between Neuroticism and fear of {AI} in both samples, with similar effect sizes. In addition to a significant association of acceptance of {AI} with gender, regression analyses revealed a small but significant positive association between Neuroticism and fear of {AI} in the German sample. In the Chinese sample, regression analyses showed positive associations of acceptance of {AI} with age, Openness, and Agreeableness. Fear of {AI} was only significantly negatively related to Agreeableness in the Chinese sample. The association of fear of {AI} with Neuroticism just failed to be significant in the regression model in the Chinese sample. These results reveal important insights into associations between certain personality traits and attitudes towards {AI}. However, given mostly small effect sizes of relations between personality and attitudes towards {AI}, other factors aside from personality traits seem to be of relevance to explain variance in individuals’ attitudes towards {AI}, as well.},

This systematic review seeks to estimate people’s attitudes toward, trust in, anxiety associated with, and acceptance of social robots; as well as factors that are associated with these beliefs. Ninety-seven studies were identified with a combined sample of over 13,000 participants and a standardized score was computed for each in order to represent the valence (positive, negative, or neutral) and magnitude (on a scale from 1 to − 1) of people’s beliefs about robots. Potential moderating factors such as the robots’ domain of application and design, the type of exposure to the robot, and the characteristics of potential users were also investigated. The findings suggest that people generally have positive attitudes towards social robots and are willing to interact with them. This finding may challenge some of the existing doubt surrounding the adoption of robotics in social domains of application but more research is needed to fully understand the factors that influence attitudes.},

	abstract = {Attitudes towards artificial intelligence ({AI}) and social robots are often depicted as different in Japan, compared to other western countries, such as Sweden. Several different reasons for why there are general differences in attitudes have been suggested. In this study, five hypotheses based on previous literature were investigated. Rather than attempting to establish general differences between groups, subjects were sampled from the respective populations, and correlations between the hypothesized confounding factors and attitudes were investigated within the groups between individuals. The hypotheses in this exploratory study concerned: (H1) animistic beliefs in inanimate objects and phenomena, (H2) worry about unemployment due to {AI} deployment, (H3) perceived positive or negative portrayal of {AI} in popular culture, (H4) familiarity with {AI}, and (H5) relational closeness and privacy with {AI}. No clear correlations between attitudes and animistic belief (H1), or portrayal of {AI} in popular culture (H3) could be observed. When it comes to the other attributes, worry about unemployment (H2), familiarity with {AI} (H4), and relational closeness and privacy (H5), the correlations were similar for the individuals in both groups and in line with the hypotheses. Thus, the general picture following this exploratory study is that individuals in the two populations are more alike than different.},

The {HRI} community uses a large variety of robotic platforms and only the {NAO} robot seems to be used by multiple research groups. A qualitative meta analysis of 18 {NAO} studies reveals accumulated findings on perceived intelligence, likability, and anthropomorphism, but also reveals contradictions on how the robot's behaviour and task context impact {GQS} ratings.

An exploratory factor analysis on a random sample revealed three factors: “anthropomorphism”, “morality/sociability”, and “activity/cooperation”. To validate these results, we performed confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) on the remaining sample and tested for validity and reliability. Reliability was appropriate. We found significant correlations between age, gender, educational level, and factors of the scale. However, missing values interfered with confirmatory and validating analyses.

Indeed, the percentage of variance explained is often under the recommended threshold for a construct to be valid. In this article, we consolidate the lessons learned from three different studies and propose a further developed questionnaire based on a multicomponent approach of anthropomorphism by adding traits from psychosocial theory about the perception of others and the attribution and deprivation of human characteristics: the de-humanization theory. Among these characteristics, the attribution of agency is of main interest in the field of social robotics as it has been argued that robots could be considered as intentional agents. Factor analyses reveal a four sub-dimensions scale including Sociability, Agency, Animacy, and the Disturbance.

The survey used the tentatively titled “Frankenstein Syndrome Questionnaire” and combined responses both from a Japanese and Western sample in order to explore common, cross-cultural factor structures in these responses. In addition, the differences between samples in terms of relationships between factors as well as other intra-sample relationships were examined. Findings suggest that the Western sample’s interfactor relationships were more structured than the Japanese sample, and that intra-sample characteristics such as age and gender were more prevalent in the Western sample than the Japanese sample. The results are discussed in relation to the notion of the Frankenstein Syndrome advanced by Kaplan [1].},

The Turkish {GAAIS} had good validity and reliability. Hierarchical Multiple Linear Regression Analyses showed that positive attitudes toward artificial intelligence were significantly predicted by the level of computer use (β = 0.139, p = 0.013), level of knowledge about artificial intelligence (β = 0.119, p = 0.029), and {AI} learning anxiety (β = −0.172, p = 0.004). Negative attitudes toward artificial intelligence were significantly predicted by agreeableness (β = 0.120, p = 0.019), {AI} configuration anxiety (β = −0.379, p {\textless} 0.001), and {AI} learning anxiety (β = −0.211, p {\textless} 0.001).

As societies develop and new technologies arise, new validated scales are needed. Robots and artificial intelligences of various kinds are about to occupy just about every niche in human society. Several tools to measure fears and anxieties about robots do exist, but there is a definite lack of tools to measure hopes and expectations for these new technologies. Here, we create and validate a novel multi-dimensional scale which measures people’s attitudes towards robots, giving equal weight to positive and negative attitudes. Our scale differentiates (a) comfort and enjoyment around robots, (b) unease and anxiety around robots, (c) rational hopes about robots in general (at societal level) and (d) rational worries about robots in general (at societal level). The scale was developed by extracting items from previous scales, crowdsourcing new items, testing through 3 scale iterations by exploratory factor analysis (Ns 135, 801 and 609) and validated in its final form of the scale by confirmatory factor analysis (N: 477). We hope our scale will be a useful instrument for social scientists who wish to study human-technology relations with a validated scale in efficient and generalizable ways.},

	shorttitle = {Measuring User Experience With 3, 5, 7, or 11 Points},
	abstract = {Objective
To assess versions of the shorter form variant of Usability Metric for User Experience ({UMUX}-{LITE}) questionnaire differing in the number of response options for the items (3, 5, 7, and 11).

Background
The {UMUX}-{LITE} is an efficient (two-item) standardized questionnaire that measures perceived usability. A growing body of evidence shows it closely corresponds to one of the most widely used standardized usability questionnaires, the System Usability Scale ({SUS}), with regard to both correlation and magnitude of concurrently collected means. Although the “standard” version of the {UMUX}-{LITE} uses items with seven response options, there is some variance in practice.

Method
Members of a corporate user experience panel ( n = 242) completed surveys rating a recent Web site experience with the {SUS} and {UMUX}-{LITE}, also providing ratings of overall experience and likelihood-to-recommend.

Results
Scale reliabilities were acceptable (coefficient α {\textgreater}.70) with the exception of {UMUX}-{LITE} with three response options. All {UMUX}-{LITE} correlations with {SUS}, overall experience, and likelihood-to-recommend were highly significant. For likelihood-to-recommend, there was a significant difference in the magnitude of correlations, with 11 response options higher than three. Although some statistically significant differences were observed in correspondence between {SUS} and {UMUX}-{LITE} scores, these did not seem to translate to practically significant differences.

Conclusion
The number of {UMUX}-{LITE} response options does not matter much, especially in practice. Because the version with three response options showed some weakness with regard to reliability and correlation with likelihood-to-recommend, practitioners should avoid it.

Application
Unless there is a strong reason to do otherwise, use the “standard” version with seven response options.},

However, in the human–computer interaction literature the relationship between the outcomes of standardized satisfaction scales and the amount of product usage has been only marginally explored. The few studies that have investigated this relationship have typically shown that users who have interacted more with a product have higher satisfaction. The purpose of this article was to systematically analyze the variation in outcomes of three standardized user satisfaction scales ({SUS}, {UMUX}, {UMUX}-{LITE}) when completed by users who had spent different amounts of time with a website. In two studies, the amount of interaction was manipulated to assess its effect on user satisfaction. Measurements of the three scales were strongly correlated and their outcomes were significantly affected by the amount of interaction time. Notably, the {SUS} acted as a unidimensional scale when administered to people who had less product experience but was bidimensional when administered to users with more experience. Previous findings of similar magnitudes for the {SUS} and {UMUX}-{LITE} (after adjustment) were replicated but did not show the previously reported similarities of magnitude for the {SUS} and the {UMUX}. Results strongly encourage further research to analyze the relationships of the three scales with levels of product exposure. Recommendations for practitioners and researchers in the use of the questionnaires are also provided.},

This paper compares four methods of measuring user cognitive load, that is, subjective rating of task difficulty, task completion time, performance accuracy and eye activity based physiological measurement. In order to be practically useful, the measurement should be sensitive to task difficulty variation and accurately predict user cognitive load. In this study, we examined the sensitivity and accuracy of these measures for five levels of cognitive load. {ANOVA} tests and Gaussian mixture model classification results show that subjective rating of task difficulty is the most effective measure, meanwhile eye activity based measure is as sensitive and accurate as using task completion time to classify two or more cognitive load levels, but has the relative advantage of being a real time measure and not requiring a specific action.},

	abstract = {In this article, we discuss cognitive load measurement techniques with regard to their contribution to cognitive load theory ({CLT}). {CLT} is concerned with the design of instructional methods that efficiently use people's limited cognitive processing capacity to apply acquired knowledge and skills to new situations (i.e., transfer). {CLT} is based on a cognitive architecture that consists of a limited working memory with partly independent processing units for visual and auditory information, which interacts with an unlimited long-term memory. These structures and functions of human cognitive architecture have been used to design a variety of novel efficient instructional methods. The associated research has shown that measures of cognitive load can reveal important information for {CLT} that is not necessarily reflected by traditional performance-based measures. Particularly, the combination of performance and cognitive load measures has been identified to constitute a reliable estimate of the mental efficiency of instructional methods. The discussion of previously used cognitive load measurement techniques and their role in the advancement of {CLT} is followed by a discussion of aspects of {CLT} that may benefit by measurement of cognitive load. Within the cognitive load framework, we also discuss some promising new techniques.},

Traditional usability metrics have shown limitations in usefulness and validity. Usability magnitude estimation is an assessment method whereby participants assign usability ‘values’ to tasks, conditions, or other user interface targets according to ratio-based number assignments. The resultant ratio-scale data is appropriate for parametric statistical analysis. This method has been used successfully in a variety of usability activities at Oracle. It has proven to be efficient, sensitive, and highly effective for comparisons using usability as a differentiator.},

Traditional approaches to mediation in the biomedical and social sciences are described. Attention is given to the confounding assumptions required for a causal interpretation of direct and indirect effect estimates. Methods from the causal inference literature to conduct mediation in the presence of exposure-mediator interactions, binary outcomes, binary mediators, and case-control study designs are presented. Sensitivity analysis techniques for unmeasured confounding and measurement error are introduced. Discussion is given to extensions to time-to-event outcomes and multiple mediators. Further flexible modeling strategies arising from the precise counterfactual definitions of direct and indirect effects are also described. The focus throughout is on methodology that is easily implementable in practice across a broad range of potential applications.},

	doi = {10.2139/ssrn.4412962},
	abstract = {Psychometric data of bipolar scales are commonly used in medical and economic psychology. Recently, their compositional structure (the Simplex) was revealed. Disregarding the Simplex causes serious bias, e.g., while estimating correlations or psychometric standards. The isometric log-ratio (ilr) transformation converts Simplex data towards the interval scale and provides unbiased statistical results. The ilr approach increases the statistical power of the well-known correlation test based on Student’s t-distribution if the prerequisites of the central limit theorem ({CLT}) are fulfilled. Concerning ilr transformed data, the {CLT} is applicable if and only if the number of summands is sufficiently large and the data generating process ({DGP}) provides finite variance. In practice, however, the number of items of a questionnaire often is small and the {DGP} could be heavy-tailed. By means of a simulation study, this paper shows that the ilr approach works satisfactory if the {DGP} is heavy-tailed with finite (Laplace) or infinite (Cauchy) variance. A violation of the {CLT} hardly affects the results of the ilr approach. The results of the simulation study generalize from correlation analysis towards a larger set of standard statistical procedures, e.g. linear regression, two-sample t-test and partial least squares structural equation modeling.},

	abstract = {Correct psychometric profiling and the choice of adequate therapeutic measures are the basis of any psychotherapeutic treatment. The preparation of a correct psychological profile benefits the patient and saves time and costs. Regarding psychometric questionnaires it is common practice to consider data of bipolar scales as interval scaled. This paper reveals the true compositional data structure (namely the Simplex) with respect to the psychometric limit of quantification of bipolar traits and constructs. The Simplex heavily affects the set of statistical procedures applicable. Disregarding the Simplex causes serious bias and results in erroneous standards and standard deviations, biased correlations, reduced convergent validity and a loss of statistical power. In this paper, the isometric log-ratio (ilr) transformation is suggested. It transforms Simplex data towards the interval scale and provides unbiased results, e.g., standards. By means of a simulation study, this paper shows that up to an 18{\textbackslash}\% increase in the statistical power of the well-known correlation test based on Student's t-distribution can be achieved. As the statistical power increases the sample size of psychometric studies can be reduced resulting in lower data collection costs. Besides economic and psychotherapeutic aspects, the results of the simulation study generalize from correlation analysis towards a larger set of standard statistical procedures. For example, testing the hypothesis of equality of the two means of independent samples using a t-test based on Student's t distribution is equivalent to testing the hypothesis of a null-correlation between the binary grouping variable and the dependent variable. Furthermore, the coefficient of correlation contributes to the slope of a regression line. Thus, the ilr approach also affects linear regression techniques.},

Examples are percentages that sum to 100, and hours in a day that sum to 24. Ipsative scales fell out of fashion in psychology during the 1960s and 1970s due to a lack of methods for analyzing them. However, ipsative scales have merits, and compositional data commonly occur in psychological research. Moreover, as we demonstrate, sometimes converting data to a compositional form yields insights not otherwise accessible. Fortunately, there are sound methods for analyzing compositional data. We seek to enable researchers to analyze compositional data by presenting appropriate techniques and illustrating their application to real data. First, we elaborate the technical details of compositional data and discuss both established and new approaches to their analysis. We then present applications of these methods to real social science data-sets (data and code using R are available in a supplementary document). We conclude with a discussion of the state of the art in compositional data analysis and remaining unsolved problems. A brief guide to available software resources is provided in the first section of the supplementary document. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2022 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Die Studie ergab, dass Expertise einen signifikant positiven Einfluss auf die Glaubwürdigkeit hat. Experten wurden demnach durchgängig für glaubwürdiger gehalten als Nicht-Experten. Die Faktoren Prominenz und Attraktivität hatten jeweils einen signifikant negativen Effekt, d.h. je prominenter und je attraktiver eine Person dargestellt wurde, umso weniger wurde ihr geglaubt.

Confidence intervals ({CIs}) have frequently been proposed as a more useful alternative to {NHST}, and their use is strongly encouraged in the {APA} Manual. Nevertheless, little is known about how researchers interpret {CIs}. In this study, 120 researchers and 442 students—all in the field of psychology—were asked to assess the truth value of six particular statements involving different interpretations of a {CI}. Although all six statements were false, both researchers and students endorsed, on average, more than three statements, indicating a gross misunderstanding of {CIs}. Self-declared experience with statistics was not related to researchers’ performance, and, even more surprisingly, researchers hardly outperformed the students, even though the students had not received any education on statistical inference whatsoever. Our findings suggest that many researchers do not know the correct interpretation of a {CI}. The misunderstandings surrounding p-values and {CIs} are particularly unfortunate because they constitute the main tools by which psychologists draw conclusions from data.},

Yet methodologists have warned that α is not an optimal measure of reliability relative to its more general form, {McDonald}’s omega (ω). Among other reasons, that the computation of ω is not available as an option in many popular statistics programs and requires items loadings from a confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) have probably hindered more widespread adoption. After a bit of discussion of α versus ω, we illustrate the computation of ω using two structural equation modeling programs (Mplus and {AMOS}) and the {MBESS} package for R. We then describe a macro for {SPSS} and {SAS} ({OMEGA}) that calculates ω in two ways without relying on the estimation of loadings or error variances using {CFA}. We show that it produces estimates of ω that are nearly identical to when using {CFA}-based estimates of item loadings and error variances. We also discuss the use of the {OMEGA} macro for certain forms of item analysis and brief form construction based on the removal of items from a longer scale.},

	abstract = {Student evaluation of teaching ({SET}) ratings are used to evaluate faculty's teaching effectiveness based on a widespread belief that students learn more from highly rated professors. The key evidence cited in support of this belief are meta-analyses of multisection studies showing small-to-moderate correlations between {SET} ratings and student achievement (e.g., Cohen, 1980, Cohen, 1981; Feldman, 1989). We re-analyzed previously published meta-analyses of the multisection studies and found that their findings were an artifact of small sample sized studies and publication bias. Whereas the small sample sized studies showed large and moderate correlation, the large sample sized studies showed no or only minimal correlation between {SET} ratings and learning. Our up-to-date meta-analysis of all multisection studies revealed no significant correlations between the {SET} ratings and learning. These findings suggest that institutions focused on student learning and career success may want to abandon {SET} ratings as a measure of faculty's teaching effectiveness.},

Yet, traditionally mindfulness was not intended to operate in a vacuum of dispassionate observation, but was seen as facilitative of eudaimonic mental states. In spite of this historical context, modern psychological research has neglected to ask the question of how the practice of mindfulness affects downstream emotion regulatory processes to impact the sense of meaning in life. To fill this lacuna, here we describe the mindfulness-to-meaning theory, from which we derive a novel process model of mindful positive emotion regulation informed by affective science, in which mindfulness is proposed to introduce flexibility in the generation of cognitive appraisals by enhancing interoceptive attention, thereby expanding the scope of cognition to facilitate reappraisal of adversity and savoring of positive experience. This process is proposed to culminate in a deepened capacity for meaning-making and greater engagement with life.},

	abstract = {Mindfulness and acceptance have been associated with the so-called third-wave behavior therapies within clinical psychology. They came from a range of philosophical origins, including problems with mechanistic approaches that focused on eliminating problematic thoughts and feelings. This concern led to a philosophical shift in cognitive–behavioral therapy ({CBT}) associated with a pragmatic analysis of treatment with a emphasis on understanding behaviors as acts in context. Theories associated with this new perspective include acceptance and commitment therapy ({ACT}), dialectical behavior therapy ({DBT}), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ({MBCT}; an adaptation of mindfulness-based stress reduction, or {MBSR}), and functional analytic psychotherapy. In this chapter, we examine the historical evolution, research evidence, treatment processes, and future directions of mindfulness and acceptance. Although these concepts have most recently been associated with the third-wave therapies, their origins are indeed quite old, with roots in ancient Eastern philosophical and spiritual traditions. A number of theories, such as those from existential–humanistic approaches, have focused on being present and acceptance of one’s current condition. We provide historical and conceptual issues that are shared in the two traditions. We then focus on specifics of some of the dominant therapies that use mindfulness and acceptance in treatment. In concluding, we describe how the integration of mindfulness and acceptance has led to a different approach to modern psychotherapy and offer future directions for the field.

The cultivation of mindfulness, involving acceptance and nonjudgment of present-moment experience, often results in transformative health behavior change. Neural systems involved in motivation and learning have an important role to play. A theoretical model of mindfulness that integrates these mechanisms with the cognitive, emotional, and self-related processes commonly described, while applying an integrated model to health behavior change, is needed. This integrative review (1) defines mindfulness and describes the mindfulness-based intervention movement, (2) synthesizes the neuroscience of mindfulness and integrates motivation and learning mechanisms within a mindful self-regulation model for understanding the complex effects of mindfulness on behavior change, and (3) synthesizes current clinical research evaluating the effects of mindfulness-based interventions targeting health behaviors relevant to psychiatric care. The review provides insight into the limitations of current research and proposes potential mechanisms to be tested in future research and targeted in clinical practice to enhance the impact of mindfulness on behavior change.},

	abstract = {Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy ({MBCT}) was developed to combine methods from cognitive behavioral therapy and meditative techniques, with the specific goal of preventing relapse in recurrent depression. While supported by empirical evidence from multiple clinical trials, the cognitive mechanisms behind the effectiveness of {MBCT} are not well understood in computational (information processing) or biological terms.This article introduces a testable theory about the computational mechanisms behind {MBCT} that is grounded in “Bayesian brain” concepts of perception from cognitive neuroscience, such as predictive coding. These concepts regard the brain as embodying a model of its environment (including the external world and the body) which predicts future sensory inputs and is updated by prediction errors, depending on how precise these error signals are.This article offers a concrete proposal how core concepts of {MBCT}—(i) the being mode (accepting whatever sensations arise, without judging or changing them), (ii) decentering (experiencing thoughts and percepts simply as events in the mind that arise and pass), and (iii) cognitive reactivity (changes in mood reactivate negative beliefs)—could be understood in terms of perceptual and metacognitive processes that draw on specific computational mechanisms of the “Bayesian brain.” Importantly, the proposed theory can be tested experimentally, using a combination of behavioral paradigms, computational modelling, and neuroimaging. The novel theoretical perspective on {MBCT} described in this paper may offer opportunities for finessing the conceptual and practical aspects of {MBCT}.},

This meta-ignorance (or ignorance of ignorance) arises because lack of expertise and knowledge often hides in the realm of the “unknown unknowns” or is disguised by erroneous beliefs and background knowledge that only appear to be sufficient to conclude a right answer. As empirical evidence of meta-ignorance, I describe the Dunning–Kruger effect, in which poor performers in many social and intellectual domains seem largely unaware of just how deficient their expertise is. Their deficits leave them with a double burden—not only does their incomplete and misguided knowledge lead them to make mistakes but those exact same deficits also prevent them from recognizing when they are making mistakes and other people choosing more wisely. I discuss theoretical controversies over the interpretation of this effect and describe how the self-evaluation errors of poor and top performers differ. I also address a vexing question: If self-perceptions of competence so often vary from the truth, what cues are people using to determine whether their conclusions are sound or faulty?},

This study carried out a psychometric review and a conceptual replication of the {FFMQ} latent structure. The review showed that previous validation studies of the {FFMQ} used nonoptimal methods. In addition, this conceptual replication study tested the structure of the {FFMQ} using frequentist and Bayesian techniques. The original structure did not provide a good fit with both techniques, while the proposed alternative provided mixed results. We also found systematic fit improvements in both techniques when the Observe facet was excluded and method factors were included. With these findings, we conclude that the conceptual replication of the {FFMQ}’s structure failed. Alternatively, we propose a new provisional {FFMQ} model with a set of recommendations regarding its application.

	abstract = {University students have to face many challenges including different social and educational settings, these changes can negatively affect their performance and develop symptoms of anxiety. Mindfulness and cognitive emotion regulation can be considered as key factors in getting awareness about one’s weakness and ability to improve it. Therefore, the present research aimed to explore the relationship between mindfulness and anxiety among students. Further, moderating role of adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation({ER}) strategy was investigated in the relationship between mindfulness and anxiety. A convenient sample of 210 students including both male (104) and female (106) age ranged between 18 to 26 years was drawn from various universities. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire ({FFMQ}), Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire ({MASQ}), and Cognitive Emotional Regulation Questionnaire ({CERQ}) were used to measure the variables under study. Correlational analysis indicated a negative relationship of mindfulness with anxiety and adaptive {CER} strategy whereas anxiety has a positive relationship with maladaptive {CER}. Furthermore, interactive effect showed moderating role of adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in relation with mindfulness and anxiety. Results revealed that maladaptive {CER} are considered as contributing factors as they lead to higher level of anxiety when combine with low level of mindfulness. Moreover, it was also suggestive fact that less use of adaptive {CER} strengthens the negative relationship between mindfulness and anxiety leading towards anxiety symptoms. Implications and suggestions have also been discussed.},

	abstract = {Mindfulness-based interventions are efficacious in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms, but mechanisms underlying these benefits have not been fully elucidated. Based on cognitive theories of depression and anxiety, a reduction in negatively biased cognition may be one mechanism. We reviewed the empirical literature on mindfulness and negatively biased cognition. Thirty-seven studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria. The evidence generally indicated that mindfulness was inversely associated with negatively biased cognition, across various measures (i.e., self-reported negatively biased cognitive styles and cognitive responses to tasks involving valenced stimuli), study designs (i.e., correlational, quasi-experimental, and experimental), and samples (i.e., unselected and clinical). However, the relation was mixed for cognitive reactivity to negative emotions in recurrent depression and null for indices of quick behavioral control. Correlational evidence in unselected samples also supported an indirect relation between mindfulness and fewer depression and anxiety symptoms through less negatively biased cognition. Mindfulness may be useful for addressing this intended mechanism of traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy. Future research should more directly test the role of negatively biased cognition in protective and therapeutic effects of mindfulness.},

Many emerging adults arrive at this developmental stage feeling the pressure and obligation for success, but lack the interpersonal resources needed to make required choices. The purpose of this study was to provide insight into the psychological and mental state of this particular group by focusing on mechanisms of self-awareness and its connection to psychological health. The present study examines whether an indirect path could explain the relationships between mindfulness, positive thinking, and positive affect. Path analysis was used to test whether decentering fosters positive thinking and positive affect. Participants were surveyed for dispositional mindfulness, frequency of positive and negative feelings, positive thinking, and rumination. Results show decentering mediates between mindfulness and positive affect but does not mediate between mindfulness and positive thinking. Rumination counteracts the effects of mindfulness and predicts negative affect.},

	abstract = {Background
Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and its prevalence is on the rise. One of the most debilitating aspects of depression is the dominance and persistence of depressive rumination, a state of mind that is linked to onset and recurrence of depression. Mindfulness meditation trains adaptive attention regulation and present-moment embodied awareness, skills that may be particularly useful during depressive mind states characterized by negative ruminative thoughts.
Methods
In a randomized controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging study (N = 80), we looked at the neurocognitive mechanisms behind mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (n = 50) for recurrent depression compared with treatment as usual (n = 30) across experimentally induced states of rest, mindfulness practice and rumination, and the relationship with dispositional psychological processes.
Results
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy compared with treatment as usual led to decreased salience network connectivity to the lingual gyrus during a ruminative state, and this change in salience network connectivity mediated improvements in the ability to sustain and control attention to body sensations.
Conclusions
These findings showed that a clinically effective mindfulness intervention modulates neurocognitive functioning during depressive rumination and the ability to sustain attention to the body.},

Indeed, several recently proposed models from the computer science community have antecedents in work from decades ago. Here, I briefly survey some of this history, focusing on underlying generative models that lead to these distributions. One finding is that lognormal and power law distributions connect quite naturally, and hence, it is not surprising that lognormal distributions have arisen as a possible alternative to power law distributions across many fields.},

We investigate the theses of “long peace” and drop in violence and find that these are statistically invalid and resulting from flawed and naive methodologies, incompatible with fat tails and non-robust to minor changes in data formatting and methodologies. There is no statistical basis to claim that “times are different” owing to the long inter-arrival times between conflicts; there is no basis to discuss any “trend”, and no scientific basis for narratives about change in risk. We describe naive empiricism under fat tails. We also establish that violence has a “true mean” that is underestimated in the track record.

Probably the most frequently used instrument is Beck's Depression Inventory ({BDI}). The simplified {BDI} ({BDI}-S) is a more efficient version of the {BDI} that has been shown to be no less reliable or valid. As the {BDI}-S has not yet been subjected to rigorous tests of Item Response Theory, it is the aim of the present paper to conduct such an analysis using the Rasch model. This study subjected a simplified version of the {BDI} consisting of 20 items ({BDI}-S20) to a Rasch analysis in a sample of N=5,035 participants. The scale, minus one misfitting item ({BDI}-S19), yielded a good approximation to Rasch assumptions. Moderate differential item functioning ({DIF}) was present. It is concluded that the {BDI}-S19 is an internally valid instrument for assessing depression, although some room for improvement exists.},

	abstract = {Measurement, the means by which numbers enter science, is of fundamental importance to modern science. The relationship between its qualitative and quantitative aspects has generated many theories and much controversy. In 19th century geometry similar developments led mathematician Felix Klein to devise a theory for unifying qualitative and quantitative approaches to geometry. Klein's theory, which today is called the Erlanger program, was based on transformation groups. In this article, the Erlanger program is given a new foundation based on mathematical logic and is extended to science. The current dominant theory of measurement in the literature, the representational theory, is then justified in terms of the new foundation for the Erlanger program. Certain inferential techniques used in dimensional analysis and the related technique of possible psychophysical laws are also given justifications in terms of the new foundation.},

A high level of confusion about these methods can be observed among students, researchers and even professional statisticians. How can a constructivist view of mathematical models and reality help to resolve the confusion? Method: Considerations about the foundations of statistics and probability are revisited with a constructivist attitude that explores which ways of thinking about the modelled phenomena are implied by different approaches to probability modelling. Results: The understanding of the implications of probability modelling for the quantification of evidence can be strongly improved by accepting that whether models are “true” or not cannot be checked from the data, and the use of the models should rather be justified and critically discussed in terms of their implications for the thinking and communication of researchers. Implications: Some useful questions that researchers can use as guidelines when deciding which approach and which model to choose are listed in the paper, along with some implications of using frequentist p-values or Bayesian posterior probability, which can help to address the questions. It is the -- far too often ignored -- responsibility of the researchers to decide which model is chosen and what the evidence suggests rather than letting the results decide themselves in an “objective way.”},

In study 1 adult females (n = 196; mean age = 21 yrs) completed the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire ({TEFQ}-R21), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and a measure of dispositional mindfulness. In study 2 adult females (n = 190; mean age = 26 yrs) completed the same measures as in study 1 with the addition of the Barratt Impulsivity Scale. In both studies it was predicted that mindfulness would be negatively related to trait disinhibition controlling for adverse psychological symptoms. The second study addressed the additional hypothesis that the relationship between mindfulness and trait disinhibition would be mediated by impulsivity. Regression analyses indicated that mindfulness was negatively related to and explained 11\% of variation in trait disinhibition (study 1). This relationship was replicated and extended in study 2 whereby impulsivity mediated the relationship between mindfulness and trait disinhibition. The findings warrant experimental and in vivo investigations of the potential causal relationships between mindfulness, impulsivity and eating behaviours.},

We administered the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory ({FMI}) and the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills ({KIMS}) to a non-clinical sample of German adults (n= 211). {BIS} was measured using the Action Regulation Emotion System Questionnaire ({ARES}), and well-being was measured using a compound variable consisting of the Marburg Habitual Well-being Scale ({MHW}) along with two subscales of the Questionnaire of General Habitual Well-Being ({FAHW}). We analysed two mediator models with the {FMI} or {KIMS} as independent variables, respectively. In both models, {BIS} was modelled as a mediator, and well-being served as the dependent variable. The total effect of mindfulness on well-being was found to be strong for both models. Also, the effect of mindfulness on the proposed mediator {BIS} was substantial, as was the effect of {BIS} on well-being. The study demonstrates that {BIS} can partially explain the pathway between mindfulness and well-being, suggesting that {BIS} may be a mediator of the effects of mindfulness. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Thus, the underlying tenets of normality-assuming statistics appear fallacious for these commonly used types of data. However, findings here also fail to support the types of distributions used in most prior robustness research suggesting the failure of such statistics under nonnormal conditions.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Genomic selection ({GS}) involves estimating breeding values using molecular markers spanning the entire genome. Accurate prediction of genomic breeding values ({GEBVs}) presents a central challenge to contemporary plant and animal breeders. The existence of a wide array of marker-based approaches for predicting breeding values makes it essential to evaluate and compare their relative predictive performances to identify approaches able to accurately predict breeding values. We evaluated the predictive accuracy of random forests ({RF}), stochastic gradient boosting (boosting) and support vector machines ({SVMs}) for predicting genomic breeding values using dense {SNP} markers and explored the utility of {RF} for ranking the predictive importance of markers for pre-screening markers or discovering chromosomal locations of {QTLs}.
{METHODS}: We predicted {GEBVs} for one quantitative trait in a dataset simulated for the {QTLMAS} 2010 workshop. Predictive accuracy was measured as the Pearson correlation between {GEBVs} and observed values using 5-fold cross-validation and between predicted and true breeding values. The importance of each marker was ranked using {RF} and plotted against the position of the marker and associated {QTLs} on one of five simulated chromosomes.
{RESULTS}: The correlations between the predicted and true breeding values were 0.547 for boosting, 0.497 for {SVMs}, and 0.483 for {RF}, indicating better performance for boosting than for {SVMs} and {RF}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Accuracy was highest for boosting, intermediate for {SVMs} and lowest for {RF} but differed little among the three methods and relative to ridge regression {BLUP} ({RR}-{BLUP}).},

We argue that data analysis is primarily a procedure to build understanding, and as such, it dovetails with the cognitive processes of the human mind. Data analysis tasks closely resemble the cognitive process known as sensemaking. We demonstrate how data analysis is a sensemaking task adapted to use quantitative data. This identification highlights a universal structure within data analysis activities and provides a foundation for a theory of data analysis. The competing tensions of cognitive compatibility and scientific rigour create a series of problems that characterise the data analysis process. These problems form a useful organising model for the data analysis task while allowing methods to remain flexible and situation dependent. The insights of this model are especially helpful for consultants, applied statisticians and teachers of data analysis.},

	abstract = {One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.{RATIONALEThere} is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.{RESULTSWe} conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, {SD} = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, {SD} = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P \&lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.{CONCLUSIONNo} single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects.Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown.

To address this omission, this paper introduces the simple difference formula. The formula states that the correlation equals the simple difference between the proportion of favorable and unfavorable evidence; in symbols this is r = f - u. For the Mann-Whitney U, the evidence consists of pairs. For the signed-rank test, the evidence consists of rank sums. Also, the formula applies to the Binomial Effect Size Display. The formula r = f - u means that a correlation r can yield a prediction so that the proportion correct is f and the proportion incorrect is u.},

Given the importance of measurement in this field, this paper aims to further our understanding of the assessment of mindfulness by employing an approach referred to as “random forests” ({RF}). {RF} is an ensemble learning method that is based on decision trees. {RF} is well known in biological research, for example, but is practically unknown in psychometrics. In this study, {RF} was used to gauge the predictive validity of the items from two mindfulness instruments concerning their ability to estimate group allocation (i.e., mindfulness practitioners vs. nonpractitioners). To allow for a better generalization of the results, we examined the research questions in two samples (N=76 and N=202) of different quality. We investigated two instruments: the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory ({FMI}) and the Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale. Although results indicated that both instruments were capable of distinguishing practitioners from nonpractitioners, the predictive quality of most items on both scales was determined to be insufficient.},

Fisher, randomization “relieves the experimenter from the anxiety of considering innumerable causes by which the data may be disturbed.” Since, in particular, it is said to control for known and unknown nuisance factors that may considerably challenge the validity of a result, it has become very popular. This contribution challenges the received view. First, looking for quantitative support, we study a number of straightforward, mathematically simple models. They all demonstrate that the optimism surrounding randomization is questionable: In small to medium-sized samples, random allocation of units to treatments typically yields a considerable imbalance between the groups, i.e., confounding due to randomization is the rule rather than the exception. In the second part of this contribution, the reasoning is extended to a number of traditional arguments in favour of randomization. This discussion is rather non-technical, and sometimes touches on the rather fundamental Frequentist/Bayesian debate. However, the result of this analysis turns out to be quite similar: While the contribution of randomization remains doubtful, comparability contributes much to a compelling conclusion. Summing up, classical experimentation based on sound background theory and the systematic construction of exchangeable groups seems to be advisable.},

These questions have been traditionally addressed by null hypothesis significance testing ({NHST}). {NHST} has deep problems that are solved by Bayesian data analysis. As psychologists transition to Bayesian data analysis, it is natural to ask how Bayesian analysis assesses null values. The article explains and evaluates two different Bayesian approaches. One method involves Bayesian model comparison (and uses Bayes factors). The second method involves Bayesian parameter estimation and assesses whether the null value falls among the most credible values. Which method to use depends on the specific question that the analyst wants to answer, but typically the estimation approach (not using Bayes factors) provides richer information than the model comparison approach.},

In addition, they generalized {CL} to the n-group case, the correlated samples case, and the discrete values case.In the current paper a different generalization of {CL}, called the A measure of stochastic superiority, is proposed, which may be directly applied for any discrete or continuous variable that is at least ordinally scaled. Exact methods for point and interval estimation as well as the significance tests of the A = .5 hypothesis are provided.

We performed an exploratory factor analysis and exploratory structural equation modeling in a cross-sectional design. The instrument was administered to N = 116,325 patients in hospitals in German-speaking countries. The overall response rates ranged from 63\% to 98\%. We found that a four-factor solution fit the data well. The four factors represented satisfaction with doctors care, nursing care, service facilities, and secondary care facilities. Cronbachs alpha ranged from .72 to .90. The findings may be of practical interest for health care providers for measuring patient satisfaction.},

We hypothesized that the "acceptance" facet of mindfulness, but not the "presence" facet, is negatively associated with the magnitude of emotional behavior in four tests, i.e., (1) rating of words, (2) rating of aversive and neutral pictures, and (3) evaluative conditioning ({EC}). Additionally, we hypothesized that (4) the acceptance facet is associated with increased reaction time ({RT}) in an emotional Stroop test, and that the presence facet is associated with decreased {RT} and lower error rate. The sample consisted of N=247 non-clinical adults and was tested in a cross-sectional study. The results provide partial evidence that the acceptance facet of mindfulness may be associated with less aversive reactions towards aversive stimuli. Future studies should substantiate these findings but also determine their clinical relevance.},

Until now, several scales have been published and to some degree also psychometrically validated. The number of scales reflects the widespread research interest. While some authors have started to compare the underlying concepts and operationalizations of these scales, up to now no overview has been presented describing, contrasting, and evaluating the different methodological approaches towards measuring mindfulness including questionnaires and alternative approaches. In light of this, the present article summarizes the state of mindfulness measurement. Recommendations on how current measurement practice may be improved are provided, as well as recommendations as to what measurement instruments are deemed to be most appropriate for a particular research context. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC}.},

We introduce a novel approach to apply extreme value theory to fat-tailed variables that have a remote, but nonetheless finite upper bound, by defining a corresponding unbounded dual distribution (given that potential war casualties are bounded by the world population). We apply methods from extreme value theory on the dual distribution and derive its tail properties. The dual method allows us to calculate the real mean of war casualties, which proves to be considerably larger than the sample mean, meaning severe underestimation of the tail risks of conflicts from naive observation. We analyze the robustness of our results to errors in historical reports, taking into account the unreliability of accounts by historians and absence of critical data. We study inter-arrival times between tail events and find that no particular trend can be asserted. All the statistical pictures obtained are at variance with the prevailing claims about "long peace", namely that violence has been declining over time.},

To keep up with this demand, attracting students early on to data science as well as providing them a solid foray into the field becomes increasingly important. We present a case study of an introductory undergraduate course in data science that is designed to address these needs. Offered at Duke University, this course has no prerequisites and serves a wide audience of aspiring statistics and data science majors as well as humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences students. We discuss the unique set of challenges posed by offering such a course, and in light of these challenges, we present a detailed discussion into the pedagogical design elements, content, structure, computational infrastructure, and the assessment methodology of the course. We also offer a repository containing all teaching materials that are open-source, along with supplementary materials and the R code for reproducing the figures found in the article.},

Method.Questionnaires which are published in peer-reviewed journals and listed in Pubmed or {PsycInfo} were included. The questionnaires were analysed and, using a content-analytical approach, the respective items were categorised and linked to the {ICF}. Results.Ten questionnaires were included. Ninety-four per cent (N=341) of the concepts could be linked to 37 different {ICF} categories. One hundred and seventy-one (50.1\%) concepts were linked to {ICF} categories of the component Body Function, 74 (21.7\%) to categories of the component Activity and Participation and none to categories of the component Environmental Factors. In total, 28.2\% of the linked concepts belonged to Personal factors, which are not yet classified in the {ICF}. The questionnaires exhibited considerable differences regarding content density (i.e. The average number of concepts per item) and content diversity (i.e. The number of {ICF} categories per concept). Conclusions.The {ICF} provides an useful external reference to identify and compare the concepts contained in mindfulness questionnaires. Also, mindfulness questionnaire concepts suggest potentially useful factors for classification within the {ICF}. © 2011 Informa {UK}, Ltd.},

While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal.

	abstract = {A lack of impressive theories in clinical psychology has been attributed to an excessive reliance on significance testing. Conjoint measurement is a worthwhile alternative to significance testing. Conjoint measurement determines whether data obey the ordinal properties of a model that contains main effect terms, interaction terms, or a combination of the two. Unlike hypothesis testing, with conjoint measurement an increase in statistical power leads to a greater risk of refuting a theory. In this study, conjoint measurement was used to describe how systems-oriented therapists predict the occurrence of suicide. Although the systems approach emphasizes the interaction between an individual and a system, all 10 clinicians were described by an additive model.},

	abstract = {Working memory is crucial for many higher-level cognitive functions, ranging from mental arithmetic to reasoning and problem solving. Likewise, the ability to learn and categorize novel concepts forms an indispensable part of human cognition. However, very little is known about the relationship between working memory and categorization, and modeling in category learning has thus far been largely uninformed by knowledge about people's memory processes. This article reports a large study (N = 113) that related people's working memory capacity ({WMC}) to their category-learning performance using the 6 problem types of Shepard, Hovland, and Jenkins (1961). Structural equation modeling revealed a strong relationship between {WMC} and category learning, with a single latent variable accommodating performance on all 6 problems. A model of categorization ({ALCOVE}) was fit to the individual data and a single latent variable was sufficient to capture the variation among associative learning parameters across all problems. The data and modeling suggest that working memory mediates category learning across a broad range of tasks.},

This chapter provides a brief overview of the current state of text mining in the biomedical domain. Emphasis is placed on the resources and tools available to biomedical researchers and practitioners, as well as the major text mining tasks of interest to the community. These tasks include the recognition of explicit facts from biomedical literature, the discovery of previously unknown or implicit facts, document summarization, and question answering. For each topic, its basic challenges and methods are outlined and recent and influential work is reviewed.},

	volume = {1},
	url = {http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=ED533155},
	abstract = {To promote student engagement, professors must actively seek to create the conditions that foster engagement. Chickering and Gamson (1987) suggest that good practices in undergraduate education are ones that: encourage student-faculty contact, develop reciprocity and cooperation among students, encourage active learning, provide students with prompt feedback, emphasize time on task, communicate high expectations and respect diverse talents and ways of knowing. The purpose of the book is to provide the reader with a variety of techniques that can be used to foster student engagement. The techniques include ways to enhance the level of academic challenge, promote active and collaborative learning, increase student-faculty interaction, provide enriching educational experiences, and create supportive learning environments. The book is divided into six sections. The first section describes factors that promote student engagement and the learning outcomes related to student engagement. The second and third sections describe programs that promote student engagement and include programs that can be implemented at the course level, programs that can be offered by a department, programs that provide for community involvement, institution-wide programs, as well as national programs. Instructors can enhance student engagement by encouraging students to become more active participants in their education. Section 4 of the book provides a number of techniques that can be used to promote active participation in the classroom. Several opportunities for student engagement are described in Section 5. The final section of the book describes several innovative approaches on how to assess student engagement.

	abstract = {Mindfulness is defined as non-judgmental present-moment attention and awareness, which varies across persons and moments. As a non-judgmental stance, mindfulness should allow for greater perceptual objectivity. Previous research suggests that self-interest can motivate people to “see what they want to see” (Balcetis \& Dunning, 2006). We hypothesized that mindfulness would moderate this effect such that state and trait mindfulness would be associated with less motivated perception. We adapted the methods of Balcetis and Dunning (2006) in an online study (N=161). Results show that state and trait mindfulness predicted less motivated perception. These effects were stronger after excluding participants who noticed the ambiguity of the image as well as controlling for mood. These findings suggest that mindfulness is a stance of greater objectivity.},

	abstract = {By both random and nonrandom assignments of numbers to rank orders (which are consistent with the monotonic nature of the categories), it is shown that ordinal variables can be treated as if they conform to interval scales. The scoring systems, of which 18 were randomly generated by a computer, resulted in negligible error when comparing any assigned scoring system with any selected "true" scoring system. Errors are determined by the Pearsonian correlation coefficient (r) and r². The advantages of treating ordinal variables as interval are demonstrated with regard to the relation between occupational prestige and suicide. These advantages include: (1) the use of more powerful, sensitive, better developed and interpretable statistics with known sampling error, (2) the retention of more knowledge about the characteristics of the data, and (3) greater versatility in statistical manipulation (e.g., partial and multiple correlation and regression, analysis of variance and covariance, and most pictorial presentations). The computer approach to this problem does not exhaust all possibilities for assigning numbers, which partially limits the generality of the findings.},

	title = {Die Konstruktion des Freiburger Fragebogens zur Achtsamkeit ({FFA}) und weitere Validierungsstudien},
	abstract = {Eine empirische Beforschung des Achtsamkeitskonzepts erfordert auch die Erfassung des Konstruktes selbst. Ob dies prinzipiell mit dem gegebenen metho- dischen Inventar der Psychologie möglich ist, wird kurz diskutiert. Zwei bereits im eng- lischen Sprachraum existierende Instrumente werden skizziert, bevor die Konstruktion und Validierung des Freiburger Fragebogens zur Achtsamkeit ({FFA}) beschrieben wird. Zunächst wurde auf der Basis einer Literaturstudie und anschließender Bewertung durch {ExpertInnen} ein Fragebogen mit 38 Items erarbeitet. Dieser wurde an Stichproben von 115 {TeilnehmerInnen} an einem Vipassana-Retreat jeweils vor und nach dem Retreat aus- gefüllt. Aus diesen Daten konnte die 30-Item-Langform des {FFA} gebildet werden, die mit einer internen Konsistenz von r = .93 und einer Vierfaktorenstruktur gute psychometri- sche Kennwerte aufweist. In einer weiteren Validierungsstudie wurde diese Langform an drei Stichproben ausgege- ben: 65 Personen, die an Achtsamkeitskursen teilnahmen, 86 Personen, die keine weiteren Verbindungen zu buddhistischen oder Meditationskonzepten hatten, sowie an eine klini- sche Stichprobe von 117 Personen. Die Stichprobe der Normalbevölkerung wies für einige Items eine geringe Trennschärfe auf. Offensichtlich werden diese nur von Menschen, die mit dem Achtsamkeitskonzept vertraut sind, semantisch verstanden. Lässt man diese schwierigen Items weg, ergibt sich eine semantisch und psychometrisch robuste Kurzform mit 14 Items (a = .87). In einer Faktorenanalyse zeigte sich hier anstatt der Vierfaktoren- struktur ein Generalfaktor. Die Korrelation mit anderen Skalen ergab eine überzeugende Validierung. Das Instrument korreliert positiv mit privater Selbstaufmerksamkeit (r = .29) und Selbstkenntnis (r = .55), jedoch negativ mit Dissoziation (r = --.29) und psychi- scher Belastung (r = --40).},

What might sound like a reasonable dictum metastasized in the twentieth century into one of science's biggest obstacles, as a legion of researchers became unwilling to make the claim that one thing could cause another. Even two decades ago, asking a statistician a question like "Was it the aspirin that stopped my headache?" would have been like asking if he believed in voodoo, or at best a topic for conversation at a cocktail party rather than a legitimate target of scientific inquiry. Scientists were allowed to posit only that the probability that one thing was associated with another. This all changed with Judea Pearl, whose work on causality was not just a victory for common sense, but a revolution in the study of the world"--},

	abstract = {Causal inference goes beyond prediction by modeling the outcome of interventions and formalizing counterfactual reasoning. Instead of restricting causal conclusions to experiments, causal inference explicates the conditions under which it is possible to draw causal conclusions even from observational data. In this paper, I provide a concise introduction to the graphical approach to causal inference, which uses Directed Acyclic Graphs ({DAGs}) to visualize, and Structural Causal Models ({SCMs}) to relate probabilistic and causal relationships. Successively, we climb what Judea Pearl calls the "causal hierarchy" --- moving from association to intervention to counterfactuals. I explain how {DAGs} can help us reason about associations between variables as well as interventions; how the do-calculus leads to a satisfactory definition of confounding, thereby clarifying, among other things, Simpson's paradox; and how {SCMs} enable us to reason about what could have been. Lastly, I discuss a number of challenges in applying causal inference in practice.},

	abstract = {The connection between race and intelligence has been a subject of debate in both popular science and academic research since the inception of {IQ} testing in the early 20th century. Since then, there have been observed differences between average {IQ} scores of different population groups, but whether and to what extent these differences reflect environmental factors as opposed to genetic ones, as well as what the definitions of "race" and "intelligence" are, and whether they can be objectively defined, is the subject of much debate. At present, there is no non-circumstantial evidence that these differences in test scores have a genetic component, although some researchers believe that the existing circumstantial evidence makes it at least plausible that hard evidence for a genetic component will eventually be found.
The first tests showing differences in {IQ} scores between different population groups in the United States were the tests of United States Army recruits in World War I. In the 1920s, groups of eugenics lobbyists argued that this demonstrated that African-Americans and certain immigrant groups were of inferior intellect to Anglo-Saxon white people, due to innate biological differences, using this as an argument for policies of racial segregation. However, soon, other studies appeared, contesting these conclusions and arguing instead that the Army tests had not adequately controlled for environmental factors, such as socio-economic and educational inequality between black people and white people. Later observations of phenomena such as the Flynn effect have also suggested that environmental factors play a greater role in group {IQ} differences than previously expected. 
The causes of differences in {IQ} test scores are not well-understood, and the topic remains controversial among researchers.},

	abstract = {Statistical science (as opposed to mathematical statistics) involves far more than probability theory, for it requires realistic causal models of data generators - even for purely descriptive goals. Statistical decision theory requires more causality: Rational decisions are actions taken to minimize costs while maximizing benefits, and thus require explication of causes of loss and gain. Competent statistical practice thus integrates logic, context, and probability into scientific inference and decision using narratives filled with causality. This reality was seen and accounted for intuitively by the founders of modern statistics, but was not well recognized in the ensuing statistical theory (which focused instead on the causally inert properties of probability measures). Nonetheless, both statistical foundations and basic statistics can and should be taught using formal causal models. The causal view of statistical science fits within a broader information-processing framework which illuminates and unifies frequentist, Bayesian, and related probability-based foundations of statistics. Causality theory can thus be seen as a key component connecting computation to contextual information, not extra-statistical but instead essential for sound statistical training and applications.},

It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use immediately. Real examples, real stories from the authors' experience demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with practical advice for understanding assumptions and implementing methods for experiments and observational studies.

	abstract = {Daten aus Zulassungsstudien wie auch aus Untersuchungen im Rahmen der breiten Anwendung (sog. Beobachtungsstudien) belegen, dass die in Deutschland zur Anwendung kommenden {COVID}-19-Impfstoffe {SARS}-{CoV}-2-Infektionen (symptomatisch und asymptomatisch) in einem erheblichen Maße verhindern. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass eine Person trotz vollständiger Impfung {PCR}-positiv wird, ist bereits niedrig, aber nicht Null.
In welchem Maß die Impfung darüber hinaus die Übertragung des Virus weiter reduziert, kann derzeit nicht genau quantifiziert werden. Auf Basis der bisher vorliegenden Daten ist davon auszugehen, dass die Viruslast bei Personen, die trotz Impfung mit {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infiziert werden, stark reduziert und die Virusausscheidung verkürzt ist.
In der Summe ist daher das Risiko einer Virusübertragung stark vermindert. Es muss jedoch davon ausgegangen werden, dass einige Menschen nach Kontakt mit {SARS}-{CoV}-2 trotz Impfung (asymptomatisch) {PCR}-positiv werden und dabei auch infektiöse Viren ausscheiden. Dieses Risiko muss durch das Einhalten der Infektionsschutzmaßnahmen zusätzlich reduziert werden. Daher empfiehlt die Ständige Impfkommission ({STIKO}) auch nach Impfung die allgemein empfohlenen Schutzmaßnahmen (Alltagsmasken, Hygieneregeln, Abstandhalten, Lüften) weiterhin einzuhalten. Das Ausmaß, in dem die Virusübertragung reduziert wird, variiert je nach Virusvariante. Bei allen derzeit dominierenden Virusvarianten ist das Risiko einer Virusübertragung stark vermindert, allerdings ist bei der Delta-Variante von einer reduzierten Wirksamkeit gegen {SARS}-{CoV}-2-Infektionen auszugehen (siehe dazu die {FAQ} "Welchen Einfluss haben die neuen Varianten von {SARS}-{CoV}-2 auf die Wirksamkeit der {COVID}-19-Impfstoffe?").

Aus Public-Health-Sicht erscheint durch die Impfung das Risiko einer Virusübertragung in dem Maß reduziert, dass Geimpfte bei der Epidemiologie der Erkrankung keine wesentliche Rolle mehr spielen.

Diese Einschätzungen beruhen auf folgender Evidenz (für eine ausführliche Darstellung siehe auch: Wie gut schützt die {COVID}-19-Impfung vor {SARS}-{CoV}-2-Infektionen und -Transmission? Systematischer Review und Evidenzsynthese):

Die Impfung hat eine hohe Schutzwirkung (mindestens 80\%) gegen schweres {COVID}-19, unabhängig vom verwendeten Impfstoff (Comirnaty von {BioNTech}/Pfizer, Spikevax von Moderna, Vaxzevria von {AstraZeneca}).
Die derzeitige Datenlage zeigt darüber hinaus, dass die Impfung mit dem {AstraZeneca}-Impfstoff wie auch mit {mRNA}-Impfstoffen zu einer deutlichen Reduktion der {SARS}-{CoV}-2-Infektionen (symptomatisch + asymptomatisch) führt (Schutzwirkung etwa 80-90\% nach der 2. Impfstoffdosis).
Weitere Daten belegen, dass selbst bei Menschen, die trotz Impfung {PCR}-positiv werden, die Viruslast signifikant reduziert wird (Ct Shift) und weniger lange anhält (verkürztes Shedding).

	title = {Single Dose Administration, And The Influence Of The Timing Of The Booster Dose On Immunogenicity and Efficacy Of {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 ({AZD}1222) Vaccine},
	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3777268},
	abstract = {Background: The {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 ({AZD}1222) vaccine has been approved for emergency use by the {UK} regulatory authority, {MHRA}, with a regimen of two standard doses given with an interval of between 4 and 12 weeks. The planned rollout in the {UK} will involve vaccinating people in high risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later.Here we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered.Methods: We present data from phase {III} efficacy trials of {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 in the United Kingdom and Brazil, and phase I/{II} clinical trials in the {UK} and South Africa, against symptomatic disease caused by {SARS}-{CoV}-2. The data cut-off date for these analyses was 7th December 2020. The accumulated cases of {COVID}-19 disease at this cut-off date exceeds the number required for a pre-specified final analysis, which is also presented. As previously described, individuals over 18 years of age were randomised 1:1 to receive two standard doses ({SD}) of {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 (5x1010 viral particles) or a control vaccine/saline placebo. In the {UK} trial efficacy cohort a subset of participants received a lower dose ({LD}, 2.2x1010 viral particles) of the {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 for the first dose. All cases with a nucleic acid amplification test ({NAAT}) were adjudicated for inclusion in the analysis, by a blinded independent endpoint review committee. Studies are registered at {ISRCTN}89951424 and {ClinicalTrials}.gov; {NCT}04324606, {NCT}04400838, and {NCT}04444674.Findings: 17,177 baseline seronegative trial participants were eligible for inclusion in the efficacy analysis, 8948 in the {UK}, 6753 in Brazil and 1476 in South Africa, with 619 documented {NAAT} +ve infections of which 332 met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection {\textgreater}14 days post dose 2.The primary analysis of overall vaccine efficacy {\textgreater}14 days after the second dose including {LD}/{SD} and {SD}/{SD} groups, based on the prespecified criteria was 66.7\% (57.4\%,  74.0\%). There were no hospitalisations in the {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 group after the initial 21 day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group.Vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 post vaccination was 76\% (59\%, 86\%), and modelled analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3 month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 day ({GMR} 0.66, 95\% {CI} 0.59, 0.74).In the {SD}/{SD} group, after the second dose, efficacy was higher with a longer prime-boost interval: {VE} 82.4\% 95\%{CI} 62.7\%, 91.7\% at 12+ weeks, compared with {VE} 54.9\%, 95\%{CI} 32.7\%, 69.7\% at {\textless}6 weeks. These observations are supported by immunogenicity data which showed binding antibody responses more than 2-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with and interval of less than 6 weeks {GMR} 2.19 (2.12, 2.26) in those who were 18-55 years of age.Interpretation: {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19 vaccination programmes aimed at vaccinating a large proportion of the population with a single dose, with a second dose given after a 3 month period is an effective strategy for reducing disease, and may be the optimal for rollout of a pandemic vaccine when supplies are limited in the short term.Trial Registration: Studies are registered at {ISRCTN}89951424 and {ClinicalTrials}.gov; {NCT}04324606, {NCT}04400838, and {NCT}04444674.Funding: {UKRI}, {NIHR}, {CEPI}, the Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation, the Lemann Foundation, Rede D’{OR}, the Brava and Telles Foundation, {NIHR} Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley and South Midland's {NIHR} Clinical Research Network, and Astra Zeneca.Conflict of Interest: Oxford University has entered into a partnership with Astra Zeneca for further development of {ChAdOx}1 {nCoV}-19. {SCG} is co-founder of Vaccitech (collaborators in the early development of this vaccine candidate) and named as an inventor on a patent covering use of {ChAdOx}1-vectored vaccines and a patent application covering this {SARS}-{CoV}-2 vaccine. {TL} is named as aninventor on a patent application covering this {SARS}-{CoV}-2 vaccine and was a consultant to Vaccitech for an unrelated project. {PMF} is a consultant to Vaccitech. {AJP} is Chair of {UK} Dept.Health and Social Care’s ({DHSC}) Joint Committee on Vaccination \& Immunisation ({JCVI}), but does not participate in discussions on {COVID}-19 vaccines, and is a member of the {WHO}’{sSAGE}. {AJP} and {SNF} are {NIHR} Senior Investigator.

Swabs were tested by nucleic acid amplification test ({NAAT}) for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and positive samples were sequenced through the {COVID}-19 Genomics {UK} consortium. Neutralising antibody responses were measured using a live-virus microneutralisation assay against the B.1.1.7 lineage and a canonical non-B.1.1.7 lineage (Victoria). The efficacy analysis included symptomatic {COVID}-19 in seronegative participants with a {NAAT} positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to vaccine received.

	abstract = {Introduction to Modern Statistics is a re-imagining of a previous title, Introduction to Statistics with Randomization and Simulation. The new book puts a heavy emphasis on exploratory data analysis (specifically exploring multivariate relationships using visualization, summarization, and descriptive models) and provides a thorough discussion of simulation-based inference using randomization and bootstrapping, followed by a presentation of the related Central Limit Theorem based approaches. Other highlights include:

Web native book. The online book is available in {HTML}, which offers easy navigation and searchability in the browser. The book is built with the bookdown package and the source code to reproduce the book can be found on {GitHub}. Along with the bookdown site, this book is also available as a {PDF} and in paperback.

Tutorials. While the main text of the book is agnostic to statistical software and computing language, each part features 4-8 interactive R tutorials (for a total of 32 tutorials) that walk you through the implementation of the part content in R with the tidyverse for data wrangling and visualisation and the tidyverse-friendly infer package for inference. The self-paced and interactive R tutorials were developed using the learnr R package, and only an internet browser is needed to complete them.

Labs. Each part also features 1-2 R based labs. The labs consist of data analysis case studies and they also make heavy use of the tidyverse and infer packages.

Datasets. Datasets used in the book are marked with a link to where you can find the raw data. The majority of these point to the openintro package. You can install the openintro package from {CRAN} or get the development version on {GitHub}.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Exposure to hate speech can have serious consequences for the mental health of immigrants and minority groups. However, not much is known about the process by which this effect takes place and to what extent it is independent of the effects of other forms of discrimination on health. The present study aimed to investigate whether acculturation stress mediates the relationship between exposure to hate speech and mental health and whether the effect would hold after controlling for experienced discrimination. Method: An online survey was conducted among Ukrainian immigrants living in Poland (N = 726) in order to investigate the relation between exposure to hate speech, acculturation stress, and mental health. Mediation analyses were used to test whether exposure to hateful language predicts posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) and depression symptoms and whether these effects are mediated by acculturation stress while controlling for experiences of other forms of discrimination. Results: Exposure to hate speech predicted {PTSD} and depression symptoms. Both effects were mediated by acculturation stress and were significant after controlling for experienced discrimination. Conclusions: The study provides evidence for the existence of a relation between exposure to hate speech among migrants and mental health problems. The study also provides support for a potential mechanism of this effect: acculturation stress and evidence for the fact that the effect holds over and above the effect of discrimination.

	abstract = {Purpose: To compare the validity, reliability and responsiveness of a single, global quality of life question to multi-item scales. Method: Data were obtained from 83 consecutive patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma undergoing either transhiatal or transthoracic oesophagectomy. Quality of life was measured at baseline, 5 weeks, 3 and 12 months post-operatively with a single-item Visual Analogue Scale ({VAS}) ranging from 0 to 100, the multi-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-20 ({MOS} {SF}-20) and Rotterdam Symptom Check-List ({RSCL}). Convergent and discriminant validity, test–retest reliability and both distribution-based and anchor-based responsiveness were evaluated. Major findings: At baseline and at 5 weeks, the {VAS} showed high correlations with the {MOS} {SF}-20 health perceptions scale (r = 0.70 and 0.72) and moderate to high correlations with all other subscales of the {MOS} {SF}-20 and {RSCL} (r = 0.29–0.70). The test–retest reliability intra-class correlation for the {VAS} was 0.87. At 5 weeks post-operatively, the distribution-based responsiveness was moderate for the {VAS} (standardised response mean: −0.47; effect size: −0.56), high for the physical subscales of the {MOS} {SF}-20 and {RSCL} (−1.08 to −1.51) and low for the psychological subscales (0.11 to −0.25). Five weeks post-operatively, anchor-based responsiveness was highest for the {VAS} (r = 0.54). Conclusion: The {VAS} is an instrument with good validity, excellent reliability, moderate distribution-based responsiveness and good anchor-based responsiveness compared to multi-item questionnaires. Its use is recommended in clinical trials to assess global quality of life.},

Methods Two large samples from Washington (N = 13,064) and Oregon (N = 2,277) recruited by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and a representative German sample (N = 1,312) recruited by the Germany Socio-Economic Panel were included in the present analyses. Single-item life satisfaction measures and the {SWLS} were correlated with theoretically relevant variables, such as demographics, subjective health, domain satisfaction, and affect. The correlations between the two life satisfaction measures and these variables were examined to assess the construct validity of single-item life satisfaction measures. Results Consistent across three samples, single-item life satisfaction measures demonstrated substantial degree of criterion validity with the {SWLS} (zero-order r = 0.62–0.64; disattenuated r = 0.78–0.80). Patterns of statistical significance for correlations with theoretically relevant variables were the same across single-item measures and the {SWLS}. Single-item measures did not produce systematically different correlations compared to the {SWLS} (average difference = 0.001–0.005). The average absolute difference in the magnitudes of the correlations produced by single-item measures and the {SWLS} was very small (average absolute difference = 0.015–0.042). Conclusions Single-item life satisfaction measures performed very similarly compared to the multiple-item {SWLS}. Social scientists would get virtually identical answer to substantive questions regardless of which measure they use.},

The goal of the present study was to scrutinize the psychometric properties of short scales (with three items) and single-item measures for two core motivational-affective constructs (i.e., academic anxiety and academic self-concept) by conducting systematic comparisons with corresponding long scales across school subjects and within different subject domains (i.e., mathematics, German, French). Statistical analyses were based on representative data from 3879 ninth-grade students. All short forms possessed satisfactory levels of reliability (range: .75–.89) and substantial correlations with the long scales (range: .88–.97); correlational patterns with educational student characteristics (e.g., achievement, school satisfaction, gender, academic track, and socioeconomic status) were comparable to those obtained with the corresponding long scales (all average differences in correlations below .07). The correlational patterns between all single-item measures and the external criteria were similar to those obtained with the corresponding long scales (all average differences in correlations below .08), yet the single-item measures demonstrated low to modest score reliabilities (estimated with the model-based omega coefficient; range: .22–.72) and correlations with full scales (range: .50–.88).

The authors conclude that for the many constructs in marketing that consist of a concrete singular object and a concrete attribute, such as {AAd} or {ABrand}, single-item measures should be used.},

	abstract = {While shorter instruments are more limited than longer measures, they have obvious benefits for both research and policy in terms of reduced burden and costs, and ease of interpretation.

A frequently asked question by clinical investigators is why they should use a lengthy, multi-item measurement scale to assess patients’ perceptions of their health, or quality of life, when there is evidence that a measure containing a single, global question is likely to suffice. Researchers may not wish to use lengthy scales because their core questionnaires are already long, the patient group of interest is ill or frail, they wish to minimise the burden on the patient and on the research team, or they simply want a “snap shot” of a topic rather than comprehensive coverage. In such circumstances, single questions have the obvious advantage of brevity, of making fewer demands than multi-item measures on respondents and researchers. Single, global questions have long been used in population surveys to measure health status, quality of life ({QoL}), and health related quality of life ({HRQoL}). The two most popular single global health items are self rated health status and self reported limiting, longstanding illness.

The classic self rated health status item consists of asking respondents to rate their health as “excellent, good, fair, or poor”. Variations of this question have been used in surveys worldwide. Literature reviews on the conceptualisation and measurement of health published by Rand in the {USA}1,2 and an overview by Stewart and Ware3 reported citations of the self rated health item as early as early as the 1950s. For example, a version appeared in a {US} study of occupational retirement4 and in the {US} Federal Civil Defense Administration Survey, both in the 1950s.5 And a question asking people to rate their general health, followed …},

	abstract = {While there is an ample amount of consumer behavior research that recruits processing fluency as an explanatory construct, the question how to best measure the fluency experience has received little attention. Therefore, there is a lack of consistency in measuring the construct, particularly with regard to the use of single-item versus multi-item measures. The current research, thus, aims to investigate how processing fluency can be consistently measured across different experimental fluency manipulations and which type of measure has the highest validity. Based on classic scale development procedures, we propose a reliable and valid multi-item measure and compare this measure against a single-item measure in terms of predictive validity. We show that both measures mediate the effect of five established fluency manipulations and that the single-item measure is sufficient. In addition to providing a measure for future research that can be adapted to different empirical settings, we provide empirical evidence on the replicability of fluency effects and on the theoretical conjecture that people have a uniform fluency experience across different manipulations of fluency.

Ss in both studies were shown a booklet containing an advertisement for a bicycle. A brand name was used, and selling price levels and advertised reference price levels varied. Results across these 2 studies, both individually and combined, support the hypothesis that buyers' internal reference prices are influenced by both advertised selling and reference prices as well as the buyers' perception of the product's quality. It was also find that the effect of advertised selling price on buyers' acquisition value was mediated by their perceptions of transaction value. In addition, the effects of perceived transaction value on buyers' behavioral intentions were mediated by their acquisition value perceptions.

The findings suggest that though satisfactory recoveries can produce a “recovery paradox” after one failure, they do not trigger such paradoxical increases after two failures. Furthermore, “double deviations” can occur following two consecutive unsatisfactory recoveries or following an unsatisfactory recovery in response to a second failure. The findings indicate that customers reporting an unsatisfactory recovery followed by a satisfactory recovery reported significantly higher ratings at the second postrecovery period than did customers reporting the opposite recovery sequence. The outcome of the second recovery also demonstrated a significant influence on customer ratings (positively if the recovery was satisfactory, negatively if the recovery was unsatisfactory), regardless of whether the customer found the first recovery satisfactory or unsatisfactory. In addition, although the increased change in recovery expectations and failure severity ratings from the first failure to the second is more dramatic for customers who previously reported a satisfactory recovery, the increase in attributions of blame toward the firm is more pronounced for customers who previously reported an unsatisfactory recovery. Last, the results show that recovery efforts are attenuated when two similar failures occur and when two failures happen in close time proximity.},

Results reveal greater amygdala activation in memorable (versus unmemorable) ads, reinforcing the association between ad-elicited emotional arousal and memory for the ad. Amygdala activation was accompanied by activation in the brain region termed the superior temporal sulcus ({STS}), which is involved in social cognition. These results are indicative of a sociocognitive emotional memory process, which has been neglected in past research. Future research directions are discussed.},

Three subjective scales were used: (1) the {VAS} (continuous scale); (2) the Borg scale (12 fixed points); and (3) the Likert scale ({LS}; 5 fixed points). Four identical submaximal tests were given (2 min at 60\% maximum oxygen uptake [o$_{\textrm{2}}$max] and 6 min at 70\% o$_{\textrm{2}}$max). Two tests were undertaken to assess the reproducibility of scores that were obtained with each subjective scale. Two other tests were undertaken to assess the sensitivity of each scale to a change in symptom perception: a double-blind treatment with propranolol, 80 mg, (\textit{ie}, active therapy; to increase the sensation of breathlessness and general fatigue during exercise) or matching placebo. The subjective scale scores were measured at 1 min 30 s, 5 min 30 s, and 7 min 15 s of exercise.

Specifically, this study employed a 2 (humanization of chatbot agent avatar: hyperrealistic-animated vs. cartoonish-still) × 2 (avatar familiarity: celebrity avatar vs. non-celebrity avatar) between-subjects experiment (N = 185), in which participants were asked to purchase a laptop from an e-commerce vendor by interacting with a chatbot agent. Based on predictions from the uncanny valley effect hypothesis ({UVE}), enhancing the human likeness of a chatbot agent through visual realism and animacy was predicted to negatively influence users’ trust in the chatbot agent and behavioral intention as a consequence of the activation of a negative affective state (i.e., a feeling of eeriness). Consistent with our predictions, the results from {PLS}-{SEM} showed that (a) enhancing the human likeness of a chatbot agent significantly increased users’ feeling of eeriness, (b) the feeling of eeriness negatively influenced users’ trust in the chatbot agent, c) trust, determined by the feeling of eeriness, significantly affected users’ purchase intention and willingness to reuse the chatbot, and d) the relationship between humanization and eeriness significantly moderated by the familiarity of the chatbot avatar. We discuss the theoretical implications of the current study on {UVE} as well as its practical implications for the implementation of anthropomorphized chatbot agents in the e-commerce context.},

These new scales have reasonable reliability (coefficient alpha of .91 and .70, respectively). They correlate highly with the overall {SUS} (r = .985 and .784, respectively) and correlate significantly with one another (r = .664), but at a low enough level to use as separate scales. A sensitivity analysis using data from 19 tests had a significant Test by Scale interaction, providing additional evidence of the differential utility of the new scales. Practitioners can continue to use the current {SUS} as is, but, at no extra cost, can also take advantage of these new scales to extract additional information from their {SUS} data. The data support the use of “awkward” rather than “cumbersome” in Item 8.},

	abstract = {This article presents nearly 10 year's worth of System Usability Scale ({SUS}) data collected on numerous products in all phases of the development lifecycle. The {SUS}, developed by Brooke (1996), reflected a strong need in the usability community for a tool that could quickly and easily collect a user's subjective rating of a product's usability. The data in this study indicate that the {SUS} fulfills that need. Results from the analysis of this large number of {SUS} scores show that the {SUS} is a highly robust and versatile tool for usability professionals. The article presents these results and discusses their implications, describes nontraditional uses of the {SUS}, explains a proposed modification to the {SUS} to provide an adjective rating that correlates with a given score, and provides details of what constitutes an acceptable {SUS} score.},

	abstract = {The validity of organizational research relies on strong research methods, which include effective measurement of psychological constructs. The general consensus is that multiple item measures have better psychometric properties than single-item measures. However, due to practical constraints (e.g., survey length, respondent burden) there are situations in which certain single items may be useful for capturing information about constructs that might otherwise go unmeasured. We evaluated 37 items, including 18 newly developed items as well as 19 single items selected from existing multiple-item scales based on psychometric characteristics, to assess 18 constructs frequently measured in organizational and occupational health psychology research. We examined evidence of reliability; convergent, discriminant, and content validity assessments; and test–retest reliabilities at 1- and 3-month time lags for single-item measures using a multistage and multisource validation strategy across 3 studies, including data from N = 17 occupational health subject matter experts and N = 1,634 survey respondents across 2 samples. Items selected from existing scales generally demonstrated better internal consistency reliability and convergent validity, whereas these particular new items generally had higher levels of content validity. We offer recommendations regarding when use of single items may be more or less appropriate, as well as 11 items that seem acceptable, 14 items with mixed results that might be used with caution due to mixed results, and 12 items we do not recommend using as single-item measures. Although multiple-item measures are preferable from a psychometric standpoint, in some circumstances single-item measures can provide useful information.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This study was designed to investigate the revised and short version of the smartphone addiction scale and the proof of its validity in adolescents. In addition, it suggested cutting off the values by gender in order to determine smartphone addiction and elaborate the characteristics of smartphone usage in adolescents.
{METHOD}: A set of questionnaires were provided to a total of 540 selected participants from April to May of 2013. The participants consisted of 343 boys and 197 girls, and their average age was 14.5 years old. The content validity was performed on a selection of shortened items, while an internal-consistency test was conducted for the verification of its reliability. The concurrent validity was confirmed using {SAS}, {SAPS} and {KS}-scale. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was conducted to suggest cut-off.
{RESULTS}: The 10 final questions were selected using content validity. The internal consistency and concurrent validity of {SAS} were verified with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.911. The {SAS}-{SV} was significantly correlated with the {SAS}, {SAPS} and {KS}-scale. The {SAS}-{SV} scores of gender (p{\textless}.001) and self-evaluation of smartphone addiction (p{\textless}.001) showed significant difference. The {ROC} analysis results showed an area under a curve ({AUC}) value of 0.963(0.888-1.000), a cut-off value of 31, sensitivity value of 0.867 and specificity value of 0.893 in boys while an {AUC} value of 0.947(0.887-1.000), a cut-off value of 33, sensitivity value of 0.875, and a specificity value of 0.886 in girls.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The {SAS}-{SV} showed good reliability and validity for the assessment of smartphone addiction. The smartphone addiction scale short version, which was developed and validated in this study, could be used efficiently for the evaluation of smartphone addiction in community and research areas.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem.

One such breakthrough technologies is Artificial Intelligence ({AI}), specifically machine learning algorithms. Nowadays, the public has little understanding of the workings and implications of {AI} techniques that are already entering their lives in many ways. We aim to achieve widespread public understanding of these issues in an experiential learning framework. Following a design based research approach, we propose to implement program coding scaffoldings to teach and experiment some basic mechanisms of {AI} systems. Such experiments would be shedding new light into {AI} potentials and limitations. In this paper we focus on innovative ways to introduce high school students to the fundamentals and operation of two of the most popular {AI} algorithms. We describe the elements of a workshop where we provide an academic use-create-modify scaffolding where students work on the Scratch partial coding of the algorithms so they can explore the behavior of the algorithm, gaining understanding of the underlying computational thinking of {AI} processes. The extent of the impact on the students of this experience is measured through questionnaires filled before and after participation in the workshop. Preliminary experiments offer encouraging results, showing that the workshop has differential impact on the way students understand {AI}.},

	abstract = {Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning techniques have shown the potential of {AI}-driven and data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and {AI} in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based “traditional” programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.},

The study ascertained that {AI} has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. {AI} initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors' duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students' assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities.

	abstract = {Using appropriate stimuli to evoke emotions is especially important for researching emotion. Psychologists have provided several standardized affective stimulus databases—such as the International Affective Picture System ({IAPS}) and the Nencki Affective Picture System ({NAPS}) as visual stimulus databases, as well as the International Affective Digitized Sounds ({IADS}) and the Montreal Affective Voices as auditory stimulus databases for emotional experiments. However, considering the limitations of the existing auditory stimulus database studies, research using auditory stimuli is relatively limited compared with the studies using visual stimuli. First, the number of sample sounds is limited, making it difficult to equate across emotional conditions and semantic categories. Second, some artificially created materials (music or human voice) may fail to accurately drive the intended emotional processes. Our principal aim was to expand existing auditory affective sample database to sufficiently cover natural sounds. We asked 207 participants to rate 935 sounds (including the sounds from the {IADS}-2) using the Self-Assessment Manikin ({SAM}) and three basic-emotion rating scales. The results showed that emotions in sounds can be distinguished on the affective rating scales, and the stability of the evaluations of sounds revealed that we have successfully provided a larger corpus of natural, emotionally evocative auditory stimuli, covering a wide range of semantic categories. Our expanded, standardized sound sample database may promote a wide range of research in auditory systems and the possible interactions with other sensory modalities, encouraging direct reliable comparisons of outcomes from different researchers in the field of psychology.},

	abstract = {Today, Machine Learning ({ML}) is of a great importance to society due to the availability of huge data and high computational resources. This ultimately led to the introduction of {ML} concepts at multiple levels of education including K-12 students to promote computational thinking. However, teaching these concepts to K-12 through traditional methodologies such as video lectures and books is challenging. Many studies in the literature have reported that using interactive environments such as games to teach computational thinking and programming improves retention capacity and motivation among students. Therefore, introducing {ML} concepts using a game might enhance students' understanding of the subject and motivate them to learn further. However, we are not aware of any existing game which explicitly focuses on introducing {ML} concepts to students using game play. Hence, in this paper, we propose {ML}-Quest, a 3D video game to provide conceptual overview of three {ML} concepts: Supervised Learning, Gradient Descent and K-Nearest Neighbor ({KNN}) Classification. The crux of the game is to introduce the definition and working of these concepts, which we call conceptual overview, in a simulated scenario without overwhelming students with the intricacies of {ML}. The game has been predominantly evaluated for its usefulness and player experience using the Technology Acceptance Model ({TAM}) model with the help of 23 higher-secondary school students. The survey result shows that around 70\% of the participants either agree or strongly agree that the {ML}-Quest is quite interactive and useful in introducing them to {ML} concepts.},

Following the trend of visual languages for introducing algorithms and programming in K-12, we present a ten-year systematic mapping of emerging visual tools that support the teaching of Machine Learning at this educational stage and analyze the tools concerning their educational characteristics, support for the development of {ML} models as well as their deployment and how the tools have been developed and evaluated. As a result, we encountered 16 tools targeting students mostly as part of short duration extracurricular activities. Tools mainly support the interactive development of {ML} models for image recognition tasks using supervised learning covering basic steps of the {ML} process. Being integrated into popular block-based programming languages (primarily Scratch and App Inventor), they also support the deployment of the created {ML} models as part of games or mobile applications. Findings indicate that the tools can effectively leverage students’ understanding of Machine Learning, however, further studies regarding the design of the tools concerning educational aspects are required to better guide their effective adoption in schools and their enhancement to support the learning process more comprehensively.},

Therefore, we developed an introductory course to teach basic {ML} concepts, such as fundamentals of neural networks as well as limitations and ethical concerns in alignment with the K-12 Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence. It also teaches the application of these concepts, by guiding the students to develop a first classification model of recycling trash images using Google Teachable Machine. In order to promote {ML} education, the interactive course is available online in Brazilian Portuguese to be used as an extracurricular course or in an interdisciplinary way as part of science classes covering recycling topics. The course was applied and evaluated through a series of exploratory case studies with a total of 108 middle and high school students. The results of the evaluation show that middle and high school students were able to understand {ML} concepts and develop an image classification model. No substantial difference with regard to the educational stage, gender and instructional mode was observed. The course was also perceived as an enjoyable learning experience motivating students to learn more about {ML}.},

However, this approach makes it difficult to identify specific model weak points. It also risks overestimating generalisable model performance due to increasingly well-evidenced systematic gaps and biases in hate speech datasets. To enable more targeted diagnostic insights, we introduce {HateCheck}, a suite of functional tests for hate speech detection models. We specify 29 model functionalities motivated by a review of previous research and a series of interviews with civil society stakeholders. We craft test cases for each functionality and validate their quality through a structured annotation process. To illustrate {HateCheck}'s utility, we test near-state-of-the-art transformer models as well as two popular commercial models, revealing critical model weaknesses.},

With the advancement in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the possibilities to predict customer churn has increased significantly.

In the third phase, feature selection is taken into consideration using gravitational search algorithm. Next, the data has been split into two parts train and test set in the ratio of 80\% and 20\% respectively. In the prediction process, most popular predictive models have been applied, namely, logistic regression, naive bayes, support vector machine, random forest, decision trees, etc. on train set as well as boosting and ensemble techniques are applied to see the effect on accuracy of models. In addition, K-fold cross validation has been used over train set for hyperparameter tuning and to prevent overfitting of models. Finally, the obtained results on test set have been evaluated using confusion matrix and {AUC} curve. It was found that Adaboost and {XGboost} Classifier gives the highest accuracy of 81.71\% and 80.8\% respectively. The highest {AUC} score of 84\%, is achieved by both Adaboost and {XGBoost} Classifiers which outperforms over others.},

Experiment was carried out in the {WEKA} Machine-learning tool, along with a real database from an American company Orange. The result were shown in different evaluation measures.},

Our experiments carried out on several benchmarks show that our approach typically requires two orders of magnitude less memory than {fastText} while being only slightly inferior with respect to accuracy.

Therefore, it is important for researchers to gain access to bot detection tools that are reliable and easy to use. This paper aims to provide an introductory tutorial of Botometer, a public tool for bot detection on Twitter, for readers who are new to this topic and may not be familiar with programming and machine learning. We introduce how Botometer works, the different ways users can access it, and present a case study as a demonstration. Readers can use the case study code as a template for their own research.

	abstract = {Today's large language models ({LLMs}) routinely generate coherent, grammatical and seemingly meaningful paragraphs of text. This achievement has led to speculation that these networks are -- or will soon become -- "thinking machines", capable of performing tasks that require abstract knowledge and reasoning. Here, we review the capabilities of {LLMs} by considering their performance on two different aspects of language use: 'formal linguistic competence', which includes knowledge of rules and patterns of a given language, and 'functional linguistic competence', a host of cognitive abilities required for language understanding and use in the real world. Drawing on evidence from cognitive neuroscience, we show that formal competence in humans relies on specialized language processing mechanisms, whereas functional competence recruits multiple extralinguistic capacities that comprise human thought, such as formal reasoning, world knowledge, situation modeling, and social cognition. In line with this distinction, {LLMs} show impressive (although imperfect) performance on tasks requiring formal linguistic competence, but fail on many tests requiring functional competence. Based on this evidence, we argue that (1) contemporary {LLMs} should be taken seriously as models of formal linguistic skills; (2) models that master real-life language use would need to incorporate or develop not only a core language module, but also multiple non-language-specific cognitive capacities required for modeling thought. Overall, a distinction between formal and functional linguistic competence helps clarify the discourse surrounding {LLMs}' potential and provides a path toward building models that understand and use language in human-like ways.},

	abstract = {The past 3 years of work in {NLP} have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. {BERT}, its variants, {GPT}-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

Their emergence has triggered numerous research efforts to develop increasingly sophisticated means to detect these accounts.

As part of this continued evolution, our research proposes a multi-model ‘tool-box’ approach in order to conduct detection at various tiers of data granularity. To support this toolbox approach this research also uses random string detection applied to user names to filter twitter streams for bot accounts and use this as labeled training data for follow on research.},

However, bot detection is not an exact science. Quantitative estimates of bot prevalence vary considerably and comparative research is rare. We show that findings on the prevalence and activity of bots on Twitter depend strongly on the methods used to identify automated accounts. We search for bots in political discourses on Twitter, using three different bot detection methods: Botometer, Tweetbotornot and “heavy automation”. We drew a sample of 122,884 unique user Twitter accounts that had produced 263,821 tweets contributing to five political discourses in five Western democracies. While all three bot detection methods classified accounts as bots in all our cases, the comparison shows that the three approaches produce very different results. We discuss why neither manual validation nor triangulation resolves the basic problems, and conclude that social scientists studying the influence of social bots on (political) communication and discourse dynamics should be careful with easy-to-use methods, and consider interdisciplinary research.},

Of these four systems the `fully Bayesian' approach of decision-making using inverse probability particularly associated with the Ramsay, De Finetti, Savage and Lindley has some claims to be the most impressive. It is claimed, however, and illustrated by example, that this approach seems to be impossible to follow. It is speculated that there may be some advantage to the practising statistician to follow George Barnard's advice of being familiar with all four systems.},

However, data is often misleading especially when trying to draw conclusions about causality (for example, Simpson’s paradox). Therefore, developing causal thinking in undergraduate statistics and data science programs is important. However, there is very little guidance in the education literature about what topics and learning outcomes, specific to causality, are most important. In this paper, we propose a causality curriculum for undergraduate statistics and data science programs. Students should be able to think causally, which is defined as a broad pattern of thinking that enables individuals to appropriately assess claims of causality based upon statistical evidence. They should understand how the data generating process affects their conclusions and how to incorporate knowledge from subject matter experts in areas of application. Important topics in causality for the undergraduate curriculum include the potential outcomes framework and counterfactuals, measures of association versus causal effects, confounding, causal diagrams, and methods for estimating causal effects.},

Sharing data and analysis code makes it easier for other researchers to reuse or check published research. However, these benefits will emerge only if researchers can reproduce the analyses reported in published articles and if data are annotated well enough so that it is clear what all variable and value labels mean. Because most researchers are not trained in computational reproducibility, it is important to evaluate current practices to identify those that can be improved. We examined data and code sharing for Registered Reports published in the psychological literature from 2014 to 2018 and attempted to independently computationally reproduce the main results in each article. Of the 62 articles that met our inclusion criteria, 41 had data available, and 37 had analysis scripts available. Both data and code for 36 of the articles were shared. We could run the scripts for 31 analyses, and we reproduced the main results for 21 articles. Although the percentage of articles for which both data and code were shared (36 out of 62, or 58\%) and the percentage of articles for which main results could be computationally reproduced (21 out of 36, or 58\%) were relatively high compared with the percentages found in other studies, there is clear room for improvement.

Together they define statistics as a scientific field in a way that differentiates it from mathematics and computer science, fields which partner with statistics today but also maintain their separate identities. These "pillars" are presented in their historical context, and some flavor of their development and variety of forms is also given in historical context. The framework of these seven is quite different from the usual ways statistical ideas are arranged, such as in most courses on the subject, and thus they give a new way to think about statistics."--},

	abstract = {Nomophobia and even simply the presence of smartphones has an impact on attention and performance, likely through the cognitive mechanism of reduced working memory capacity. When a smartphone, a personally relevant stimulus, is present, working memory capacity is utilized leading to a reduction in the ability to inhibit responses and therefore difficulty with complex attentional tasks. With the increase in smartphone ownership, especially among young adults in developing nations and their proliferation in undergraduate classrooms, it becomes important to understand their cognitive impact in this demographic of users. Therefore, this study evaluated the impact of the presence of undergraduate students’ smartphones on their performance on a non-verbal reasoning task, as well as a series of simple to complex attentional tasks. A total of 154 Pakistani undergraduate students participated in this study. Results demonstrated that the presence or absence of the students’ smartphones did not affect fluid non-verbal intelligence or simple attentional tasks. However, the level of fear of being without their smartphone was correlated with non-verbal fluid intelligence and simple attention. Importantly, when the students’ smartphones were present, they experienced difficulty with a more complex attentional task, regardless of the level of nomophobia. Given the need for fluid reasoning and the complex nature of most material covered within the undergraduate classroom context, this finding indicates a need for education about the detrimental nature of smartphone presence on complex attention, as well as the relationship between nomophobia and fluid reasoning and attention. Implications also include a need for institutional policies clarifying appropriate use of smartphones in the classroom.},

            This meta-analysis systematically reviewed the evidence on standardized acceptance-/mindfulness-based interventions in {DSM}-5 anxiety disorders. Randomized controlled trials examining Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ({ACT}), Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy ({MBCT}), and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ({MBSR}) were searched via {PubMed}, Central, {PsycInfo}, and Scopus until June 2021. Standardized mean differences ({SMD}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) were calculated for primary outcomes (anxiety) and secondary ones (depression and quality of life). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. We found 23 studies, mostly of unclear risk of bias, including 1815 adults with different {DSM}-5 anxiety disorders. {ACT}, {MBCT} and {MBSR} led to short-term effects on clinician- and patient-rated anxiety in addition to treatment as usual ({TAU}) versus {TAU} alone. In comparison to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ({CBT}), {ACT} and {MBCT} showed comparable effects on both anxiety outcomes, while {MBSR} showed significantly lower effects. Analyses up to 6 and 12 months did not reveal significant differences compared to {TAU} or {CBT}. Effects on depression and quality of life showed similar trends. Statistical heterogeneity was moderate to considerable. Adverse events were reported insufficiently. The evidence suggests short-term anxiolytic effects of acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions. Specific treatment effects exceeding those of placebo mechanisms remain unclear.

            The effectiveness of most cancer targeted therapies is short lived since tumors evolve and develop resistance. Combinations of drugs offer the potential to overcome resistance, however the number of possible combinations is vast necessitating data-driven approaches to find optimal treatments tailored to a patient’s tumor. {AstraZeneca} carried out 11,576 experiments on 910 drug combinations across 85 cancer cell lines, recapitulating
            in vivo
            response profiles. These data, the largest openly available screen, were hosted by {DREAM} alongside deep molecular characterization from the Sanger Institute for a Challenge to computationally predict synergistic drug pairs and associated biomarkers. 160 teams participated to provide the most comprehensive methodological development and subsequent benchmarking to date. Winning methods incorporated prior knowledge of putative drug target interactions. For {\textgreater}60\% of drug combinations synergy was reproducibly predicted with an accuracy matching biological replicate experiments, however 20\% of drug combinations were poorly predicted by all methods. Genomic rationale for synergy predictions were identified, including antagonism unique to combined {PIK}3CB/D inhibition with the {ADAM}17 inhibitor where synergy is seen with other {PI}3K pathway inhibitors. All data, methods and code are freely available as a resource to the community.},

	abstract = {There is an ongoing discussion about the definition of mindfulness including the question whether mindfulness is a one-dimensional or multidimensional construct. Research on the Freiburg mindfulness inventory ({FMI}) has also reflected this debate. We have investigated the psychometric properties of the {FMI}-14-item in an online convenience sample of n=244 individuals (150 female; mean age 28.7 ({SD}=8.76)) with (n=75) and without (n=169) regular meditative training). A simplified version of the beck depression inventory ({BDI}-V) and the trait subscale of the state-trait-anxiety-inventory ({STAI}-T) were used for determining criterion validity. A one-dimensional (α=.83) and an alternative two-dimensional solution (αF1=.77; αF2=.69) of the {FMI}-14 were tested with a confirmatory factor analysis and yielded suboptimal fit indices. An exploratory analysis resulted in a reduced 8-item version of the two-dimensional solution with better fit indices, but low internal consistency (αF1=.71; αF2=.64). The factors could be identified as “Presence” (F1) and “Acceptance” (F2). Further investigation revealed that the substantial negative relationship between mindfulness and anxiety and depression is completely due to the “Acceptance” factor of mindfulness. This suggests that there may be heuristic value in the two-factorial solution, although for practical purposes it seems sufficient to assess mindfulness as one-dimensional construct.},

	abstract = {Turmoil has engulfed psychological science. Causes and consequences of the reproducibility crisis are in dispute. With the hope of addressing some of its aspects, Bayesian methods are gaining increasing attention in psychological science. Some of their advantages, as opposed to the frequentist framework, are the ability to describe parameters in probabilistic terms and explicitly incorporate prior knowledge about them into the model. These issues are crucial in particular regarding the current debate about statistical significance. Bayesian methods are not necessarily the only remedy against incorrect interpretations or wrong conclusions, but there is an increasing agreement that they are one of the keys to avoid such fallacies. Nevertheless, its flexible nature is its power and weakness, for there is no agreement about what indices of "significance" should be computed or reported. This lack of a consensual index or guidelines, such as the frequentist p-value, further contributes to the unnecessary opacity that many non-familiar readers perceive in Bayesian statistics. Thus, this study describes and compares several Bayesian indices, provide intuitive visual representation of their "behavior" in relationship with common sources of variance such as sample size, magnitude of effects and also frequentist significance. The results contribute to the development of an intuitive understanding of the values that researchers report, allowing to draw sensible recommendations for Bayesian statistics description, critical for the standardization of scientific reporting.},

Further modeling options include autocorrelation of the response variable, user defined covariance structures, censored data, as well as meta-analytic standard errors. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs.

	abstract = {Psychological theories are statements of constraint. The role of hypothesis testing in psychology is to test whether specific theoretical constraints hold in data. Bayesian statistics is well suited to the task of finding supporting evidence for constraint, because it allows for comparing evidence for 2 hypotheses against each another. One issue in hypothesis testing is that constraints may hold only approximately rather than exactly, and the reason for small deviations may be trivial or uninteresting. In the large-sample limit, these uninteresting, small deviations lead to the rejection of a useful constraint. In this article, we develop several Bayes factor 1-sample tests for the assessment of approximate equality and ordinal constraints. In these tests, the null hypothesis covers a small interval of non-0 but negligible effect sizes around 0. These Bayes factors are alternatives to previously developed Bayes factors, which do not allow for interval null hypotheses, and may especially prove useful to researchers who use statistical equivalence testing. To facilitate adoption of these Bayes factor tests, we provide easy-to-use software. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2019 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type {II} errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

This article describes a Bayesian approach to determining sample sizes in the sequential development of interventions. Description: Because sample sizes are related to the likelihood of detecting program effects, large samples are preferred. But in the design and development process that characterizes intervention research, smaller scale studies are usually required to justify more costly, larger scale studies. We present 4 scenarios designed to address common but complex questions regarding sample-size determination and the risk of observing misleading (e.g., false-positive) findings. From a Bayesian perspective, this article describes the use of decision rules composed of different target probabilities and prespecified effect sizes. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to demonstrate a Bayesian approach—which tends to require smaller samples than the classical frequentist approach—in the development of interventions from one study to the next.},

A general gradient descent boosting paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such {TreeBoost} models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data.

	abstract = {In many ways, the report of a psychology research project contains a recipe. Without accurate descriptions of the ingredients (the manipulations and measures) and the instructions (research design and implementation), it is impossible for others to replicate what you have done. Recently, there has been a growing sense in the social and behavioral sciences that the recipes contained in our research reports often do not serve us well. Recognizing this, in 2006 the Publications and Communications Board (P\&C Board) of the American Psychological Association ({APA}) formed a group, the Journal Article Reporting Standards Working Group ({JARS} Working Group), to look into the issue. This chapter presents what {JARS} recommends for information to include in all reports on new quantitative data collections. However, these all-purpose recommendations contain only brief entries regarding (a) the type of research design one employed and (b) one's basic statistical analyses.

	abstract = {This article explains the foundational concepts of Bayesian data analysis using virtually no mathematical notation. Bayesian ideas already match your intuitions from everyday reasoning and from traditional data analysis. Simple examples of Bayesian data analysis are presented, that illustrate how the information delivered by a Bayesian analysis can be directly interpreted.
Bayesian approaches to null-value assessment are discussed. The article clarifies misconceptions about Bayesian methods that newcomers might have acquired elsewhere. We discuss prior distributions and explain how they are not a liability but an important asset. We discuss
the relation of Bayesian data analysis to Bayesian models of mind, and we briefly discuss what methodological problems Bayesian data analysis is not meant to solve. After you have read this article, you should have a clear sense of how Bayesian data analysis works and the sort of information it delivers, and why that information is so intuitive and useful for drawing conclusions from data.},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type {II} errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

	abstract = {Experiments in research on memory, language, and in other areas of cognitive science are increasingly being analyzed using Bayesian methods. This has been facilitated by the development of probabilistic programming languages such as Stan, and easily accessible front-end packages such as brms. The utility of Bayesian methods, however, ultimately depends on the relevance of the Bayesian model, in particular whether or not it accurately captures the structure of the data and the data analyst's domain expertise. Even with powerful software, the analyst is responsible for verifying the utility of their model. To demonstrate this point, we introduce a principled Bayesian workflow (Betancourt, 2018) to cognitive science. Using a concrete working example, we describe basic questions one should ask about the model: prior predictive checks, computational faithfulness, model sensitivity, and posterior predictive checks. The running example for demonstrating the workflow is data on reading times with a linguistic manipulation of object versus subject relative clause sentences. This principled Bayesian workflow also demonstrates how to use domain knowledge to inform prior distributions. It provides guidelines and checks for valid data analysis, avoiding overfitting complex models to noise, and capturing relevant data structure in a probabilistic model. Given the increasing use of Bayesian methods, we aim to discuss how these methods can be properly employed to obtain robust answers to scientific questions.

Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

For example, such beliefs have been shown to be a major factor steering students away from taking science and math courses in high school and college. In the present study, we tested a novel story-based instruction that models how scientists achieve through failures and struggles. We designed this instruction to challenge this belief, thereby improving science learning in classroom settings. A demographically diverse group of 402 9th and 10th grade students read 1 of 3 types of stories about eminent scientists that described how the scientists (a) struggled intellectually (e.g., made mistakes in investigating scientific problems, and overcame the mistakes through effort), (b) struggled in their personal life (e.g., suffered family poverty and lack of parental support but overcame it), or (c) made great discoveries (a control condition, similar to the instructional material that appears in many science textbooks, that did not describe any struggles). Results showed that participation in either of the struggle story conditions improved science learning postintervention, relative to that of students in the control condition. Additionally, the effect of our intervention was more pronounced for low-performing students. Moreover, far more students in either of the struggle story conditions felt connected to the stories and scientists than did students in the control condition. The use of struggle stories provides a promising and implementable instructional approach that can improve student motivation and academic performance in science and perhaps other subjects as well.

In a large and diverse cross-cultural sample (N = 10,195 from 24 countries), we presented participants with obscure, meaningless statements attributed to either a spiritual guru or a scientist. We found a robust global source credibility effect for scientific authorities, which we dub ‘the Einstein effect’: across all 24 countries and all levels of religiosity, scientists held greater authority than spiritual gurus. In addition, individual religiosity predicted a weaker relative preference for the statement from the scientist compared with the spiritual guru, and was more strongly associated with credibility judgements for the guru than the scientist. Independent data on explicit trust ratings across 143 countries mirrored our experimental findings. These findings suggest that irrespective of one’s religious worldview, across cultures science is a powerful and universal heuristic that signals the reliability of information.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Many of the nearly 30 million Americans suffering with migraine headaches are not helped by standard therapies, a proportion of which can harbor undesirable side effects. The present study demonstrates the efficacy of independent surgical deactivation of three common migraine headache trigger sites through a double-blind, sham surgery, controlled clinical trial.
{METHODS}: Seventy-five patients with moderate to severe migraine headache who met International Classification of Headache Disorders {II} criteria were studied. Trigger sites were identified (frontal, temporal, and occipital), and patients were randomly assigned to receive either actual or sham surgery in their predominant trigger site. Patients completed the Migraine Disability Assessment, Migraine-Specific Quality of Life, and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey health questionnaires before treatment and at 1-year follow-up.
{RESULTS}: Of the total group of 75 patients, 15 of 26 in the sham surgery group (57.7 percent) and 41 of 49 in the actual surgery group (83.7 percent) experienced at least 50 percent reduction in migraine headache (p {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, 28 of 49 patients in the actual surgery group (57.1 percent) reported complete elimination of migraine headache, compared with only one of 26 patients in the sham surgery group (3.8 percent) (p {\textless} 0.001). Compared with the control group, the actual surgery group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all validated migraine headache measurements at 1 year. These improvements were not dependent on the trigger site. The most common surgical complication was slight hollowing of the temple in the group with temporal migraine headache.
{CONCLUSION}: This study confirms that surgical deactivation of peripheral migraine headache trigger sites is an effective alternative treatment for patients who suffer from frequent moderate to severe migraine headaches that are difficult to manage with standard protocols.},

Because mindfulness meditation encourages judgment-free thoughts and feelings, we predicted that participants in the mindfulness condition would be especially likely to form false memories. In two experiments, participants were randomly assigned to either a mindfulness induction, in which they were instructed to focus attention on their breathing, or a mind-wandering induction, in which they were instructed to think about whatever came to mind. The overall number of words from the Deese-Roediger-{McDermott} paradigm that were correctly recalled did not differ between conditions. However, participants in the mindfulness condition were significantly more likely to report critical nonstudied items than participants in the control condition. In a third experiment, which tested recognition and used a reality-monitoring paradigm, participants had reduced reality-monitoring accuracy after completing the mindfulness induction. These results demonstrate a potential unintended consequence of mindfulness meditation in which memories become less reliable.},

The current research experimentally investigated how state mindfulness influences task motivation and performance, using multiple meditation inductions, comparison conditions, tasks, and participant samples. Mindfulness inductions, relative to comparison conditions, reduced motivation to tackle mundane tasks (Experiments 1–4) and pleasant tasks (Experiment 2). Decreased future focus and decreased arousal serially mediated the demotivating effect of mindfulness (Experiments 3 and 4). In contrast to changes in motivation, inducing a state of mindfulness did not affect task performance, as seen in all experiments but one (Experiments 2–5). Meta-analyses of performance experiments, including unreported findings (i.e., the file drawer), supported these conclusions. Experiment 5’s serial mediation showed that mindfulness enabled people to detach from stressors, which improved task focus. When combined with mindfulness’s demotivating effects, these results help explain why mindfulness does not alter performance.},

The results showed that mindfulness meditation exercises increased sensitivity to time and lengthened perceived time. However, this temporal improvement with meditation exercises was primarily observed in the experienced meditators. Our results also showed the experienced meditators were less anxious than the novice participants, and that the sensitivity to time increased when the level of anxiety decreased.

However, to date, the data regarding the impact of mindfulness on memory—and specifically on memory distortions—is scarce and incomplete. The present study was aimed to examine whether mindfulness practice would have an effect on true and false memories. To this end, the effect of mindfulness meditation practice on memory performance was examined in two experiments in which false memories were provoked using the Deese-Roediger-{McDermott} ({DRM}) paradigm (Roediger \& {McDermott}, 1995). In Experiment 1, college students were randomly divided into either a 5-week mindfulness-practice group (n = 29) or a waitlist control group (n = 22). In Experiment 2, college students were randomly divided into either a brief mindfulness session (n = 21) or a mind-wandering control group (n = 19). The results indicated that mindfulness increased the recognition of true memories with no effect on spontaneous false-memories, yet increased the rate of provoked false-memories. These findings are discussed in terms of memory sensitivity and response bias, and it is argued that mindfulness may have a lesser effect on encoding processes than previously suggested.},

Confidence intervals ({CIs}) have frequently been proposed as a more useful alternative to {NHST}, and their use is strongly encouraged in the {APA} Manual. Nevertheless, little is known about how researchers interpret {CIs}. In this study, 120 researchers and 442 students—all in the field of psychology—were asked to assess the truth value of six particular statements involving different interpretations of a {CI}. Although all six statements were false, both researchers and students endorsed, on average, more than three statements, indicating a gross misunderstanding of {CIs}. Self-declared experience with statistics was not related to researchers’ performance, and, even more surprisingly, researchers hardly outperformed the students, even though the students had not received any education on statistical inference whatsoever. Our findings suggest that many researchers do not know the correct interpretation of a {CI}. The misunderstandings surrounding p-values and {CIs} are particularly unfortunate because they constitute the main tools by which psychologists draw conclusions from data.},

	abstract = {P values linked to null hypothesis significance testing ({NHST}) is the most widely (mis)used method of statistical inference. Empirical data suggest that across the biomedical literature (1990–2015), when abstracts use P values 96\% of them have P values of 0.05 or less. The same percentage (96\%) applies for full-text articles. Among 100 articles in {PubMed}, 55 report P values, while only 4 present confidence intervals for all the reported effect sizes, none use Bayesian methods and none use false-discovery rate. Over 25 years (1990–2015), use of P values in abstracts has doubled for all {PubMed}, and tripled for meta-analyses, while for some types of designs such as randomized trials the majority of abstracts report P values. There is major selective reporting for P values. Abstracts tend to highlight most favorable P values and inferences use even further spin to reach exaggerated, unreliable conclusions. The availability of large-scale data on P values from many papers has allowed the development and applications of methods that try to detect and model selection biases, for example, p-hacking, that cause patterns of excess significance. Inferences need to be cautious as they depend on the assumptions made by these models and can be affected by the presence of other biases (e.g., confounding in observational studies). While much of the unreliability of past and present research is driven by small, underpowered studies, {NHST} with P values may be also particularly problematic in the era of overpowered big data. {NHST} and P values are optimal only in a minority of current research. Using a more stringent threshold, as in the recently proposed shift from P {\textless} 0.05 to P {\textless} 0.005, is a temporizing measure to contain the flood and death-by-significance. {NHST} and P values may be replaced in many fields by other, more fit-for-purpose, inferential methods. However, curtailing selection biases requires additional measures, beyond changes in inferential methods, and in particular reproducible research practices.},

This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09104},
	abstract = {Learning about cause and effect is arguably the main goal in applied econometrics. In practice, the validity of these causal inferences is contingent on a number of critical assumptions regarding the type of data that has been collected and the substantive knowledge that is available. For instance, unobserved confounding factors threaten the internal validity of estimates, data availability is often limited to non-random, selection-biased samples, causal effects need to be learned from surrogate experiments with imperfect compliance, and causal knowledge has to be extrapolated across structurally heterogeneous populations. A powerful causal inference framework is required to tackle these challenges, which plague most data analysis to varying degrees. Building on the structural approach to causality introduced by Haavelmo (1943) and the graph-theoretic framework proposed by Pearl (1995), the artificial intelligence ({AI}) literature has developed a wide array of techniques for causal learning that allow to leverage information from various imperfect, heterogeneous, and biased data sources (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016). In this paper, we discuss recent advances in this literature that have the potential to contribute to econometric methodology along three dimensions. First, they provide a unified and comprehensive framework for causal inference, in which the aforementioned problems can be addressed in full generality. Second, due to their origin in {AI}, they come together with sound, efficient, and complete algorithmic criteria for automatization of the corresponding identification task. And third, because of the nonparametric description of structural models that graph-theoretic approaches build on, they combine the strengths of both structural econometrics as well as the potential outcomes framework, and thus offer an effective middle ground between these two literature streams.},

In this study, we explicitly focus on the benefits of interactions where a human inspector is assisted by {AI} solutions. A case study is conducted for predictive maintenance of wind farms, where endoscopic images were used for bearing fault detection. The experiment consisted of 54 technical inspectors and 2301 images collected over 138 wind turbines, and each inspector was shown images and asked to identify bearing faults in the absence and presence of {AI}-assistance. The results showed that {AI}-assistance had a statistically significant impact on improving the technical inspector’s specificity and time efficiency. The level of improvement was dependent on the level of expertise, where the generalist group showed greater improvements in specificity and time efficiency (24.6\% and 25.3\%, respectively) when compared with the specialist group (4.7\% and 6.4\%, respectively). Both groups responded positively on the reuse intention and usefulness of {AI}-assistance, and the change in cognitive load was not statistically significant.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things ({IoT}) and Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) play a vital role in the upcoming years to improve the assistance systems. The {IoT} devices utilize several sensor devices that able to collect a large volume of data in different domains which is processed by {AI} techniques to make the decision about the assistance problems. Among several applications, in this work, {IoT} with {AI} is used to examine the healthcare sectors to improve patient assistance and patient care in the future direction. Traditional health care assistance system fails to predict the exact patient health information and needs which reduces the accuracy of patient assistance process. For these issues, an {IoT} sensor with {AI} is used to predict the exact patient details such as fitness tracker, medical reports, health activity, body mass, temperature, and other health care information which helps to choose the right assistance process. Healthcare mobile application is used to achieve this goal and collect the patient’s information. This information is shared in the cloud environment, which is accessed and processed by applying the optimized machine learning techniques. The gathered patient details are processed according to the iterative golden section optimized deep belief neural network ({IGDBN}). The introduced network examines the patient’s details from the previous health information which helps to predict the exact patient health condition in the future direction. The efficiency of {IoT} sensor with an {AI}-based health assistance prediction process is developed using {MATLAB} tool. Excellence is determined in terms of precision (99.87), loss error (0.045), simple matching coefficient (99.71\%), Matthews correlation coefficient (99.10\%) and accuracy (99.86\%).},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This paper aims to examine the effects of subjective and financial literacy, big five personality traits and emotions (fear, anger, hope and sadness) on risk aversion, risky investment intention and investment choices were investigated. Interactions of these three variables (risk aversion, risky investment intention and investment choices) were also examined.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              
                For this purpose, in January-February 2019, collected data on 446 subjects from Turkey using the internet (341) and face-to-face (105) survey instruments. The authors exploited {IBM} {SPSS} Statistics for analysis. {ANOVA},
                t
                -test and discriminant analysis were performed.
              
            
            
              Findings
              As a result of the analyzes, two personality traits (neuroticism and openness) and two emotions (fear and sadness) were determined as predictors of risk aversion. For risky investment intention, risk aversion, two personality traits (neuroticism and openness) and one of the same and other one different two emotions (fear and anger) were found.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Investment choices can be estimated by objective financial literature, risk aversion and risky investment intention. In addition, individuals’ risk averse or risk taking characteristics differ according to their level of sadness with agreeableness, conscientiousness and neuroticism personality traits. Similarly, have a risky investment intention or have not risky investment intention also differs according to sadness emotions with conscientiousness and openness. Finally, the choice of stocks or bank deposits varies according to subjective financial literacy and extraversion personality trait.},

Eines der am weitesten verbreiteten Verfahren zur Erfassung von Impulsivität ist die Barratt Impulsiveness Scale ({BIS}-11; Patton, Stanford \& Barratt, 1995 ). Es wurde gezeigt, dass die drei Faktoren nicht-planende, motorische und aufmerksamkeitsbasierte Impulsivität auch ausreichend gut mit einer verkürzten Form der {BIS}-11 erfasst werden können ({BIS}-15; Spinella, 2007 ). Die vorliegende Arbeit stellt diese Kurzversion der {BIS}-11 in einer deutschen Übersetzung vor. Reliabilität und Faktorstruktur des Fragebogens wurden in einer Stichprobe (N = 752) von überwiegend Studierenden getestet. Die dreifaktorielle Struktur von Spinella (2007) konnte bestätigt werden. Die interne Konsistenz war gut (Cronbachs α = .81). In einer zweiten Studie (N = 51) zeigte sich konvergente Validität durch Zusammenhänge mit einem anderen Impulsivitätsmaß ({UPPS}). Die {BIS}-15 empfiehlt sich durch ihre guten psychometrischen Kennwerte und ihre ökonomische Durchführbarkeit für die Erfassung von Impulsivität im deutschen Sprachraum.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Linear regression analyses commonly involve two consecutive stages of statistical inquiry. In the first stage, a single ‘best’ model is defined by a specific selection of relevant predictors; in the second stage, the regression coefficients of the winning model are used for prediction and for inference concerning the importance of the predictors. However, such second-stage inference ignores the model uncertainty from the first stage, resulting in overconfident parameter estimates that generalize poorly. These drawbacks can be overcome by model averaging, a technique that retains all models for inference, weighting each model’s contribution by its posterior probability. Although conceptually straightforward, model averaging is rarely used in applied research, possibly due to the lack of easily accessible software. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we provide a tutorial on linear regression using Bayesian model averaging in , based on the {BAS} package in . Firstly, we provide theoretical background on linear regression, Bayesian inference, and Bayesian model averaging. Secondly, we demonstrate the method on an example data set from the World Happiness Report. Lastly, we discuss limitations of model averaging and directions for dealing with violations of model assumptions.},

	abstract = {There is ample evidence that masking and social distancing are effective in reducing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) transmission. However, due to the complexity of airborne disease transmission, it is difficult to quantify their effectiveness, especially in the case of one-to-one exposure. Here, we introduce the concept of an upper bound for one-to-one exposure to infectious human respiratory particles and apply it to {SARS}-{CoV}-2. To calculate exposure and infection risk, we use a comprehensive database on respiratory particle size distribution; exhalation flow physics; leakage from face masks of various types and fits measured on human subjects; consideration of ambient particle shrinkage due to evaporation; and rehydration, inhalability, and deposition in the susceptible airways. We find, for a typical {SARS}-{CoV}-2 viral load and infectious dose, that social distancing alone, even at 3.0 m between two speaking individuals, leads to an upper bound of 90\% for risk of infection after a few minutes. If only the susceptible wears a face mask with infectious speaking at a distance of 1.5 m, the upper bound drops very significantly; that is, with a surgical mask, the upper bound reaches 90\% after 30 min, and, with an {FFP}2 mask, it remains at about 20\% even after 1 h. When both wear a surgical mask, while the infectious is speaking, the very conservative upper bound remains below 30\% after 1 h, but, when both wear a well-fitting {FFP}2 mask, it is 0.4\%. We conclude that wearing appropriate masks in the community provides excellent protection for others and oneself, and makes social distancing less important.},

Design Prospective cohort study following patients from the time of acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (glandular fever), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), or Ross River virus (epidemic polyarthritis).
Setting The region surrounding the township of Dubbo in rural Australia, encompassing a 200 km geographical radius and 104 400 residents.
Participants 253 patients enrolled and followed at regular intervals over 12 months by self report, structured interview, and clinical assessment.
Outcome measures Detailed medical, psychiatric, and laboratory evaluations at six months to apply diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Premorbid and intercurrent illness characteristics recorded to define risk factors for chronic fatigue syndrome. Self reported illness phenotypes compared between infective groups.
Results Prolonged illness characterised by disabling fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, neurocognitive difficulties, and mood disturbance was evident in 29 (12\%) of 253 participants at six months, of whom 28 (11\%) met the diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. This post-infective fatigue syndrome phenotype was stereotyped and occurred at a similar incidence after each infection. The syndrome was predicted largely by the severity of the acute illness rather than by demographic, psychological, or microbiological factors.
Conclusions A relatively uniform post-infective fatigue syndrome persists in a significant minority of patients for six months or more after clinical infection with several different viral and non-viral micro-organisms. Post-infective fatigue syndrome is a valid illness model for investigating one pathophysiological pathway to chronic fatigue syndrome.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the statistical distributions of the position and the size of the evaporating droplets after a cough are evaluated, thus characterizing the inherent stochasticity of respiratory releases due to turbulence. For that, ten independent realizations of a cough with realistic initial conditions and in a room at 20 °C and 40\% relative humidity were performed with large eddy simulations and Lagrangian tracking of the liquid phase. It was found that although turbulence decreases far from the emitter, it results in large variations in the spatial distribution of the droplets. The total suspended liquid mass after 60 s from the cough is in good agreement with that estimated by a one-dimensional model accounting for settling and evaporation under quiescent conditions, while deposition times of droplets in the 10–100 μm range are found to vary significantly, reflected in the mass of liquid, and hence the virus content, potentially inhaled by a receptor. The high variability between events is due to the local fluctuations of temperature, humidity, and velocity on droplet evaporation and motion. The droplet distribution suggests that, in the absence of face coverings, an unprotected cough is not safe at 2 m away from the emitter even outdoors. The results indicate that mitigation measures, such as ventilation to address long-range transmission, can be based on the total suspended liquid content evaluated from reduced-order models. However, the large variability of viral content in the near field produces wide variations in estimates of risk; therefore, a stochastic approach is needed for evaluating short-range transmission risk.},

	abstract = {Introduction Excess mortality is a suitable indicator of health consequences of {COVID}-19 because death from any cause is clearly defined contrary to death from Covid-19. We compared the overall mortality in 2020 with the overall mortality in 2016 to 2019 in Germany, Sweden and Spain. Contrary to other studies, we also took the demographic development between 2016 and 2020 and increasing life expectancy into account. Methods Using death and population figures from the {EUROSTAT} database, we estimated weekly and cumulative Standardized Mortality Ratios ({SMR}) with 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) for the year 2020. We applied two approaches to calculate weekly numbers of death expected in 2020: first, we used mean weekly mortality rates from 2016 to 2019 as expected mortality rates for 2020, and, second, to consider increasing life expectancy, we calculated expected mortality rates for 2020 by extrapolation from mortality rates from 2016 to 2019. Results In the first approach, the cumulative {SMRs} show that in Germany and Sweden there was no or little excess mortality in 2020 ({SMR} = 0.976 (95\% {CI}: 0.974–0.978), and 1.030 (1.023–1.036), respectively), while in Spain the excess mortality was 14.8\% (1.148 (1.144–1.151)). In the second approach, the corresponding {SMRs} for Germany and Sweden increased to 1.009 (1.007–1.011) and 1.083 (1.076–1.090), respectively, whereas results for Spain were virtually unchanged. Conclusion In 2020, there was barely any excess mortality in Germany for both approaches. In Sweden, excess mortality was 3\% without, and 8\% with consideration of increasing life expectancy.},

	abstract = {Comparing the impact of the {COVID}-19 pandemic between countries or across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the expected mortality, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the {COVID}-19 death toll. However, there has been no global, frequently updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or quarterly all-cause mortality data from 103 countries and territories, openly available as the regularly updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to compute the excess mortality in each country during the {COVID}-19 pandemic. We found that in several worst-affected countries (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) the excess mortality was above 50\% of the expected annual mortality (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) or above 400 excess deaths per 100,000 population (Peru, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Serbia). At the same time, in several other countries (e.g. Australia and New Zealand) mortality during the pandemic was below the usual level, presumably due to social distancing measures decreasing the non-{COVID} infectious mortality. Furthermore, we found that while many countries have been reporting the {COVID}-19 deaths very accurately, some countries have been substantially underreporting their {COVID}-19 deaths (e.g. Nicaragua, Russia, Uzbekistan), by up to two orders of magnitude (Tajikistan). Our results highlight the importance of open and rapid all-cause mortality reporting for pandemic monitoring.},

Further, he mentions the so called {ROPE}-only decision rule within his supplementary material, which is based on {ROPE}, but uses the full posterior information instead of the {HDI}. Of course, if it is about formalizing and guiding decisions then statistical decision theory is the framework to rely on, and this technical report elaborates the decision theoretic foundations of both decision rules. It appears that the foundation of the {HDI}+{ROPE} decision rule is rather artificial compared to the foundation of the {ROPE}-only decision rule, such that latter might be characterized as being closer to the underlying practical purpose than former. Still, the {ROPE}-only decision rule employs a truly arbitrary, and thus debatable, choice of loss values.},

The present study aimed to investigate the link between mindful attention awareness, perceived stress and subjective wellbeing without the presence of a complementary intervention to promote mindfulness-based strategies. Methods: The online survey participants (N = 257) were university students enrolled in initial teacher training. Self-report measures included the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale ({MAAS}), Perceived Stress Scale ({PSS}) and Personal Wellbeing Index ({PWI}). Results: {PWI} was negatively correlated with {PSS} (r = −0.550, p = .001), {MAAS} was negatively correlated with {PSS} (r = −0.567, p = .001) and positively correlated with {PWI} (r = 0.336, p = .001). The mean score for {PSS} (M = 20.61, {SD} = 6.62) was above the reported norm (14.2). Conclusions: The findings suggest that higher levels of mindful attention awareness may be associated with lower levels of perceived stress and higher subjective wellbeing levels and lower levels of perceived stress may be associated with higher subjective wellbeing. The findings confirm that pre-service teachers are a demographic that experiences elevated levels of perceived stress regardless of the stage in initial teacher training programs.},

So far, studies have shown that practicing mindfulness on a consistent and regular basis can improve attentional functions and emotional well-being. Mindfulness has recently begun to be used in the field of child development. The goal of this study is to assess if a mindfulness program may help primary school students in reducing anxiety and depression while also improving their temperamental characteristics. This multi-arm pre-post study included 41 subjects recruited in the fifth year of two primary school classes. Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. The experimental group, but not the control group, underwent an eight-week mindfulness training. Every week, the program included 60-min group sessions. {QUIT} (Italian Questionnaires of Temperament) and {TAD} (Test for Anxiety and Depression in Childhood and Adolescence) were used to assess temperament, and anxiety and depression, respectively. Both groups were administered both instruments before and after mindfulness intervention. The mindfulness program lowered anxiety levels and was effective in changing temperament dimensions: there was an increase in social orientation ({SO}), positive emotionality ({PE}), and attention ({AT}), as well as a decrease in inhibition to novelty ({IN}) and negative emotionality. Path analysis revealed that {AT} may promote the improvement of both {SO} and {IN}. Similarly, {PE} may be promoted by the decrease of {IN}. Clinical implications are discussed.},

A portion of the respondents were randomly pre-assigned to a condition that induced mindfulness. On 19 of the 22 biases, those induced to be mindful were less likely to show the bias. They also scored higher on 11 of the 14 {LMS} questions. The method by which we induced mindfulness was unrelated to the context of the later questions, involving image comparisons and standard Langerian instructions to notice three new things.

              To develop a fine-grained phenomenological analysis of “pure awareness” experiences in meditators.
            
            
              Methods
              An online survey in five language versions (German, English, French, Spanish, Italian) collected data from January to March 2020. A total of 92 questionnaire items on a visual analogue scale were submitted to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.
            
            
              Results
              Out of 3627 submitted responses, 1403 were usable. Participants had a median age of 52 years (range: 17–88) and were evenly split between men and women (48.5\% vs 50.0\%). The majority of meditators practiced regularly (77.3\%), were free of diagnosed mental disorders (92.4\%) and did not regularly use any psychoactive substances (84.0\%). Vipassana (43.9\%) followed by Zen (34.9\%) were the most frequently practiced meditation techniques. German (63.4\%) and English (31.4\%) were by far the most frequent questionnaire languages. A solution with 12 factors explaining 44\% of the total variance was deemed optimal under joint conceptual and statistical considerations. The factors were named “Time, Effort and Desire,” “Peace, Bliss and Silence,” “Self-Knowledge, Autonomous Cognizance and Insight,” “Wakeful Presence,” “Pure Awareness in Dream and Sleep,” “Luminosity,” “Thoughts and Feelings,” “Emptiness and Non-egoic Self-awareness,” “Sensory Perception in Body and Space,” “Touching World and Self,” “Mental Agency,” and “Witness Consciousness.” This factor structure fit the data moderately well.

                We have previously posited a
                phenomenological prototype
                for the experience of “pure awareness” as it occurs in the context of meditation practice. Here we offer a tentative 12-factor model to describe its phenomenal character in a fine-grained way. The current findings are in line with an earlier study extracting semantic constraints for a working definition of minimal phenomenal experience.},

	abstract = {Emotional intelligence is an essential trait and skill for healthcare professionals. Mindfulness meditation has proved to be effective in increasing the wellbeing of those who practice it, leading to better mental health, self-care and job satisfaction. This paper aims to identify the recent evidence on the relationship between mindfulness and emotional intelligence among healthcare professionals and students. A systematic review was conducted including the databases {PubMed}, Cinhal, {PsycINFO} and Web of Science. The main variables were emotional intelligence skills and mindfulness practice. Data were extracted according to the following outcomes: authors, year of publication, country, study design, participants, mindfulness training intervention, tools used in data collection and main results. The following inclusion criteria were applied: peer-reviewed articles; published in English or Spanish; published between 2010 and 2020; quantitative methodology; a study population of healthcare professionals or students; the relationship with the aim of the study. The Joanna Briggs Institute criteria were followed for assessing the methodological quality of the selected studies. Three researchers were involved in the review. After the selection process, 10 studies were selected out of the 197 references initially identified. These studies revealed a positive relationship between mindfulness and emotional intelligence, particularly the capacity to regulate emotions. Furthermore, mindfulness is negatively related to emotional exhaustion. Training interventions based on mindfulness have proved to be useful in promoting emotional balance, emotional awareness, emotional acceptance, emotion recognition, expressive suppression and a reduction in emotional exhaustion. This study could serve as a basis for further research on the benefits of emotional intelligence and practicing mindfulness for the bio-psycho-social welfare of healthcare professionals.},

              Background
              Mindfulness-based meditation practice ({MBP}) can be assessed in terms of time spent (quantity) or skill acquisition (quality), but these components have rarely been delineated in adherence measures. Individuals may also engage in {MBP} through everyday life (informal practice) and dedicate specific time for {MBP} (formal practice).
            
            
              Method
              
                The Mindfulness Adherence Questionnaire, a scale designed to assess quantity and quality of formal and informal {MBP} was evaluated. Study 1 used a cross-sectional design to examine internal reliability and construct validity (
                N
                 = 282). Study 2 examined test–retest reliability and sensitivity (
                N
                 = 55) during a 4-week mindfulness intervention.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                A nested-factor model showed adequate fit: {MAQ} items loaded on both the general factor (
                Practice
                ) and specific factors (
                Formal and Informal
                ). Discriminant validity analyses revealed the {MAQ} captured {MBP} adherence distinct from trait mindfulness.
                Quality
                of both formal and informal mindfulness practice was more strongly associated with higher levels of trait mindfulness than
                quantity
                . Changes in {MAQ}
                Quantity
                scores were observed over time.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              The {MAQ} is reliable and has a meaningful scale structure, may usefully distinguish both quality versus quantity and formal versus informal {MBP}, and is sensitive to variations in {MBP} and does not solely measure trait mindfulness.},

Young adults who just participated in physical activity (N = 394) completed a survey to assess state mindfulness and theoretically relevant constructs about affect, motivation, and body image. An exploratory factor analysis was used to reduce the item pool on half of the sample. A 19-item and 15-item version of the {SMS}-{PA}2 were further tested through confirmatory factor analysis on the second half of the sample demonstrating a theoretically based factor structure representing either a total score or four separate factors – monitoring of the mind and body and accepting of the mind and body. The {SMS}-{PA}2 scores demonstrated evidence supporting construct and incremental validity through associations with theoretically relevant variables. Initial evidence shows expanded predictive utility of the {SMS}-{PA}2.},

mindfulness tendency, specifically in the awareness and attention
dimensions and also in the observing, describing, acting with awareness and

Methods: In June 2020 an on-line questionnaire was administered to nurses
in order to analyze any differences both in the Mindfulness Attention
Awareness Scale ({MAAS}) and the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills
({KIMS}) according to gender variable.
Findings: 200 questionnaires were collected. Findings showed significant
higher {MAAS} total score in males than females (p=.004). Additionally, by
considering the four sub dimensions in the Mindfulness tendency, females
reported significant higher levels in some items of “Observe” (p=.004) and
“Act with awareness” (p=.001) than males, while males reported significant
higher scores in the “Accept without judgement” than females (p{\textless}.001).
Conclusions: The present study was a pilot research on exploring gender
differences in mindfulness in Italian nurses in order to hope that it will be
only the beginning of empirical research on this topic and to better address
future mindfulness training courses addressed to nurses by emphasizing
certain aspects of mindfulness for females compared to males and vice versa."},

In three independent studies, the factor structure of the Langer Mindfulness/Mindlessness Scale was examined. Confirmatory factor analysis failed to replicate the four-factor model and a subsequent exploratory factor analysis revealed the presence of a two-factor (mindfulness and mindlessness) solution. Study 2 demonstrated that the two factors assessed discrete constructs and were not merely products of acquiescence. Support was also found for a nine-item, one-factor model comprised solely of mindfulness items. On comparing models, Study 3 suggested the superiority of the one-factor mindfulness model. Finally, a preliminary investigation of the concurrent validity of the revised nine-item Langer Mindfulness/Mindlessness Scale is presented. The current article offers researchers a revised version of a mindfulness measure derived from a cognitive perspective.},

Sample: A total of 225 participants responded to the first survey and 230 completed the second survey. Measures: {LMS}, self-report questions on personality, openness and attention, as well as health and clinical evaluations (including cognitive and behavioural assessments). Results: On the basis of factor analysis, principal component analysis and item response analysis, the initial 21-items were reduced to six items. The resulting unidimensional scale showed high internal consistency (α = 0.82) and good test–re-test reliability (intra-class correlation for total score = 0.46). External validity was confirmed for the entire sample. Conclusion: It was concluded that the German short form of the original {LMS} ({MCS}) is a valid and reliable measure of mindful creativity.},

These elements of mindfulness can be measured with the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire ({FFMQ}). The authors investigated several aspects of the construct validity of the {FFMQ} in experienced meditators and nonmeditating comparison groups. Consistent with predictions, most mindfulness facets were significantly related to meditation experience and to psychological symptoms and well-being. As expected, relationships between the observing facet and psychological adjustment varied with meditation experience. Regression and mediation analyses showed that several of the facets contributed independently to the prediction of well-being and significantly mediated the relationship between meditation experience and well-being. Findings support the construct validity of the {FFMQ} in a combination of samples not previously investigated.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} Mindfulness-based interventions ({MBIs}), with postures, breath, relaxation, and meditation, such as Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction ({MBSR}) and yoga, are complex interventions increasingly used for trauma-related psychiatric conditions. Prior reviews have adopted a disorder-specific focus. However, trauma is a risk factor for most psychiatric conditions. We adopted a transdiagnostic approach to evaluate the efficacy of {MBIs} for the consequences of trauma, agnostic to diagnosis. {AMED}, {CINAHL}, Central, Embase, Pubmed/Medline, {PsycINFO}, and Scopus were searched to 30 September 2018 for controlled and uncontrolled trials of mindfulness, yoga, tai chi, and qi gong in people specifically selected for trauma exposure. Of {\textgreater}12,000 results, 66 studies were included in the systematic review and 24 controlled studies were meta-analyzed. There was a significant, pooled effect of {MBIs} (g = 0.51, 95\%{CI} 0.31 to 0.71, p {\textless} .001). Similar effects were observed for mindfulness (g = 0.45, 0.26 to 0.64, p {\textless} .001), yoga (g = 0.46, 0.26 to 0.66, p {\textless} .001), and integrative exercise (g = 0.94, 0.37 to 1.51, p = .001), with no difference between interventions. Outcome measure or trauma type did not influence the effectiveness, but interventions of 8 weeks or more were more effective than shorter interventions (Q = 8.39, df = 2, p = .02). Mindfulness-based interventions, adjunctive to treatment-as-usual of medication and/or psychotherapy, are effective in reducing trauma-related symptoms. Yoga and mindfulness have comparable effectiveness. Many psychiatric studies do not report trauma exposure, focusing on disorder-specific outcomes, but this review suggests a transdiagnostic approach could be adopted in the treatment of trauma sequelae with {MBIs}. More rigorous reporting of trauma exposure and {MBI} treatment protocols is recommended to enhance future research.},

Within this time period, they were prompted 22 times at irregular intervals to indicate whether they had lost mindful contact with their breath as a result of mind wandering. The results show negative correlations between the degree of the ability to stay mindfully in contact with the breath and measures of rumination, repetitive negative thinking, and depression. Moreover, positive associations with self-report data of mindfulness and a negative relationship to fear of bodily sensations support the construct validity of our new approach for the assessment of mindfulness. In summary, findings suggest the healthy quality of mindful breathing regarding depression-related processes.},

The discriminative ability of the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale ({MAAS}), the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire ({FFMQ}), and a breath counting task ({BCT}) was assessed in a randomized control trial involving an 8-week mindfulness training ({MT}) condition (n = 53) and an active control computerized attention training ({CT}) program (n = 33). No evidence to support the discriminant validity of {MAAS} or {FFMQ} scores was found, as these self-report measures responded to both the {MT} and {CT} conditions. Breath counting scores however demonstrated unique responsiveness to the {MT} program, suggesting this behavioral task may be useful in measuring changes in mindfulness as it closely resembles core cognitive processes trained during this practice. Implications of these findings for the construct validity of both self-report and behavioral measures of mindfulness are discussed, along with the suitability of current mindfulness-based interventions in studies aiming to assess mindfulness outcomes.

However, the popularity of these measures does not necessarily mean that they are of high quality. Especially considering the complex epistemology and ontology of the mindfulness construct, we should apply mindfulness assessments with caution. More specially, according to item development theorists in the industrial and organizational (I-O) area (see Hinkin, 1998; Hinkin \& Tracey, 1999; Kerlinger \& Lee, 2000; Schriesheim, Powers, Scandura, Gardiner, \& Lankau, 1993), scholars must select measures that have (a) a clear operational definition; (b) alignment between definition and measure (content validity); (c) high reliability and (d) high construct validity; and (e) high criterion-related validity. However, it is not clear which of the available mindfulness assessments satisfies these criteria and to what extent.

              Objectives
              The aim of the study was to assess the convergent and divergent validity, reliability, utility, and treatment sensitivity of a newly translated German version of the Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire ({SMQ}). The {SMQ} is a 16-item instrument measuring mindful awareness of distressing thoughts, images, and perceptions, developed originally within the mindfulness for psychosis field.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Overall, three studies were conducted, comprising (1) a non-clinical sample of
                n
                 = 848 (638 community sample and 210 meditators); (2) a clinical sample of
                n
                 = 213 (106 schizophrenia and 107 depression); and (3) a clinical sample with
                n
                 = 122 participants with emotional disorders within a randomized controlled study, of which 30 participants were also included in study 2. To assess convergent validity, participants completed the {SMQ}, Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory ({FMI}), and Comprehensive Inventory of Mindfulness Experiences ({CHIME}). To measure divergent validity, participants completed the Brief Symptom Inventory 18 ({BSI}-18), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ({PANAS}), Brief Experiential Avoidance Questionnaires ({BEAQ}), and Anxiety Sensitivity Index 3 ({ASI}-3).
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Mean internal consistency (α = 0.89) and convergent (
                r
                 = 0.66 to 0.73) and divergent validity (
                r
                 = − 0.09 to − 0.50) were established and sensitivity to change over time following treatment (
                d
                 = 0.86) was shown. For the clinical sample, a single-factor structure is suggested by principal component analysis.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Results provide first evidence for the utility of the German version of the {SMQ} for clinical practice and research in healthy individuals, meditators, and clinical groups. Further research is needed to examine the underlying construct of mindfulness.},

Correspondingly, the empirical study of mindfulness has steadily grown; thus, the availability of valid measures of the construct is critically important. This paper gives an overview of the current status in the field of self-report assessment of mindfulness. All eight currently available and validated mindfulness scales (for adults) are evaluated, with a particular focus on their virtues and limitations and on differences among them. It will be argued that none of these scales may be a fully adequate measure of mindfulness, as each of them offers unique advantages but also disadvantages. In particular, none of them seems to provide a comprehensive assessment of all aspects of mindfulness in samples from the general population. Moreover, some scales may be particularly indicated in investigations focusing on specific populations such as clinical samples (Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale, Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire) or meditators (Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory). Three main open issues are discussed: (1) the coverage of aspects of mindfulness in questionnaires; (2) the nature of the relationships between these aspects; and (3) the validity of self-report measures of mindfulness. These issues should be considered in future developments in the self-report assessment of mindfulness.},

In contrast, the present study aims at giving a comprehensive overview of the effects of mindfulness meditation on various psychological variables, for meditators in nonclinical settings. Included are 39 studies that fulfilled our six selection criteria: (1) a mindfulness meditation treatment, (2) the existence of an inactive control group, (3) a population of nonclinical adults, (4) the investigation of psychological measures that were (5) assessed at temporal distance from a meditation session, and (6) the availability of sufficient data to calculate effect sizes. The dependent variables examined included, among others, attention, intelligence, self-attributed mindfulness, positive and negative emotions, emotion regulation, personality traits, self-concept, self-realization, stress, and well-being. We found an effect size of \$\$ {\textbackslash}overline r = 0.27 \$\$ averaged across all studies and dependent variables. The effects differed widely across dependent variables. Moreover, we found large differences between the effect sizes reported for complete Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction ({MBSR}) programs vs. “pure” meditation. {MBSR} seems to have its most powerful effect on attaining higher psychological well-being, whereas pure mindfulness meditation studies reported the largest effects on variables associated with the concept of mindfulness. This raises the question if some effect sizes found for {MBSR} might be partly inflated by effects that are not attributable to its mindfulness meditation component. Future theorizing should address meditation-specific concepts more extensively to account for the changes in healthy practitioners.},

              Objectives
              Despite various methodological concerns, previous studies mainly use questionnaires to assess mindfulness. Following a multi-measurement approach, the present study aimed to evaluate the added value of an experience-sampling measure in the context of posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) and depression.
            
            
              Method
              
                Data were collected in a {PTSD} group, depression group, and control group (each
                n
                = 33). The Mindful-Breathing Exercise ({MBE}) was used as an experience-sampling method and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire ({FFMQ}) as a mindfulness questionnaire. Clinical variables included {PTSD} and depressive symptoms.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Scores from the {MBE} and the {FFMQ} were positively correlated in the control group (
                r
                = 0.48) and the depression group (
                r
                = 0.28), while a non-significant correlation emerged for the {PTSD} group. On the level of {FFMQ} facets, results were heterogeneous among the three groups. The {MBE} predicted hyperarousal (
                β
                = − 0.41) and intrusions (
                β
                = − 0.32) in the {PTSD} group, whereas the {FFMQ} predicted depressive symptoms in the depression group (
                β
                = − 0.41) and the control group (
                β
                = − 0.65). Compared to the control group, the {PTSD} group (
                d
                = 1.88) and the depression group (
                d
                = 1.67) demonstrated lower {FFMQ} scores. In terms of the {MBE}, there was a trend towards higher scores in the control group than either clinical group.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Findings hint at conceptual overlaps and distinctive features of both measurement approaches. With respect to the clinical context, results suggest an added value of the {MBE} to questionnaire-based assessments of mindfulness with respect to its predictive value for hyperarousal and intrusions.

              Objectives
              The aim of the study was to assess the convergent and divergent validity, reliability, utility, and treatment sensitivity of a newly translated German version of the Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire ({SMQ}). The {SMQ} is a 16-item instrument measuring mindful awareness of distressing thoughts, images, and perceptions, developed originally within the mindfulness for psychosis field.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Overall, three studies were conducted, comprising (1) a non-clinical sample of
                n
                 = 848 (638 community sample and 210 meditators); (2) a clinical sample of
                n
                 = 213 (106 schizophrenia and 107 depression); and (3) a clinical sample with
                n
                 = 122 participants with emotional disorders within a randomized controlled study, of which 30 participants were also included in study 2. To assess convergent validity, participants completed the {SMQ}, Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory ({FMI}), and Comprehensive Inventory of Mindfulness Experiences ({CHIME}). To measure divergent validity, participants completed the Brief Symptom Inventory 18 ({BSI}-18), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ({PANAS}), Brief Experiential Avoidance Questionnaires ({BEAQ}), and Anxiety Sensitivity Index 3 ({ASI}-3).
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Mean internal consistency (α = 0.89) and convergent (
                r
                 = 0.66 to 0.73) and divergent validity (
                r
                 = − 0.09 to − 0.50) were established and sensitivity to change over time following treatment (
                d
                 = 0.86) was shown. For the clinical sample, a single-factor structure is suggested by principal component analysis.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Results provide first evidence for the utility of the German version of the {SMQ} for clinical practice and research in healthy individuals, meditators, and clinical groups. Further research is needed to examine the underlying construct of mindfulness.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
 Mindfulness presents a self-regulation tool allowing the individual to recognize and accept mental experiences. We chose to validate the short form of {FMI} called {FMI}-14, since it contains all aspects of the original long version and it can be used among various general population. Interests in including mindfulness techniques in medical and psychological fields has been increasing recently. Accordingly, it is important to validate {FMI}-14-Ar to help professionals living in the Arabic speaking countries. Thus, the main objective of this study was to validate the Arabic version of the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory ({FMI}-Ar) among a sample of Lebanese university students.
Methods
 This study is a cross-sectional one carried out between July and September 2021 and enrolling 363 Lebanese university students recruited through convenience sampling through several Lebanese universities. The questionnaire included socio-demographic characteristics and the following scales: Lebanese Anxiety Scale ({LAS}-10) to assess anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire ({PHQ}-9) to assess depression and Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory ({FMI}) to assess mindfulness. To estimate categorical confirmatory factor analysis of the {FMI} scale the Mplus was used and {SPSS} software version 23 was used for data analysis.
Results
 Participants mean age was 22.65 ± 3.48 years, and the majority 61.7\% were females. The fit indices of the confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) of the one-factor model of the {FMI} came out as follows: χ
            2
            /df= 218.33/77=2.83, {RMSEA}= 0.071 [0.060-0.082], {CFI}=0.92 and {TLI}= 0.90. The Cronbach’s alpha value for the total scale was excellent (0.92). Additionally, the {FMI} score was negatively associated with anxiety (r=-0.48; p{\textless}0.001) and depression (r=-0.51; p=0.001).
Conclusion
 All hypotheses (factor, convergent, and divergent validity) related to the {FMI}-Ar were verified in our study. Therefore, professionals can now benefit from the {FMI}-Ar, a suitable scale to measure mindfulness among Lebanese university students.},

Nevertheless, the construct of mindfulness has not yet been subjected to scientific validation. The aim of this study has been the empirical analysis of the Buddhist concept of mindfulness and the construction of a measurement scale that operationalizes the construct. The stages of development of a self-evaluative mindfulness inventory are presented in three phases: 1. construction of a pool of items, 2. expert assessment of items, and 3. validation by means of a study in which a preliminary form of a questionnaire was given to four samples of individuals participating in insight meditation retreats; a pre-retreat (n=100), post-retreat (n=93) design was employed. Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients of the 30-item final questionnaire were 0.91 before the course and 0.94 after. For each time of inventory completion, a four-factor solution was found using principal components factor analysis. Factor structure was only moderately stable over time. The four factors primarily reflected the theoretical and conceptual characteristics of mindfulness. Our data indicates one-dimensionality of the construct and the presence of a general factor. The mindfulness inventory provides an economic, valid, homogeneous and reliable instrument, which could be optimized and employed in further research studies.},

	abstract = {Objective: Response-shift has been cited as an important measurement consideration when assessing patient reported quality of life ({QoL}) outcomes over time among patients with severe chronic conditions. Here we report the results of a systematic review of response shift in studies assessing {QoL} among cancer patients.Methods: A systematic review using {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, and {PsychINFO} along with a manual search of the cited references of the articles selected, was conducted. A quality review was performed using {STROBE} criteria and reported according to {PRISMA} guidelines.Results: A systematic review of 1,487 records published between 1,887 and December 2018 revealed 104 potentially eligible studies, and 35 studies met inclusion criteria for content and quality. The most common cancer patient populations investigated in these studies were breast (18 studies), lung (14 studies), prostate (eight studies), and colorectal (eight studies). Response shift was identified among 34 of the 35 studies reviewed. Effect sizes were reported in 17 studies assessing {QoL} outcomes among cancer patients; 12 of which had negligible to small effect sizes, four reported medium effect sizes which were related to physical, global {QoL}, pain, and social (role) functioning and one reported a large effect size (fatigue). The most prevalent method for assessing response shift was the then-test, which is prone to recall bias, followed by the pre-test and post-test method. Given the heterogeneity among the characteristics of the samples and designs reviewed, as well as the overall small to negligible effect sizes for the effects reported, conclusions stating that changes due to internal cognitive shifts in perceived {QoL} should account for changes observed in cancer patients' {QoL} outcomes should be interpreted with caution.Conclusion: Further work is needed in this area of research. Future studies should control for patient characteristics, time elapsed between diagnosis and baseline assessment and evaluate their contribution to the presence of response shift. Time between assessments should include short and longer periods between assessments and evaluate whether the presence of response shift holds over time. Possible avenues for inquiry for future investigation are discussed.},

It introduces the concept of identification thoroughly and clearly and discusses it as a process of trying to isolate variation that has a causal interpretation.

There is limited research in the {IT} implementation literature that deals with the role of interventions to aid such managerial decision making. Particularly, there is a need to understand how various interventions can influence the known determinants of {IT} adoption and use. To address this gap in the literature, we draw from the vast body of research on the technology acceptance model ({TAM}), particularly the work on the determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and: (i) develop a comprehensive nomological network (integrated model) of the determinants of individual level ({IT}) adoption and use; (ii) empirically test the proposed integrated model; and (iii) present a research agenda focused on potential pre- and postimplementation interventions that can enhance employees' adoption and use of {IT}.

Study 2 tested whether psychological factors (Big Five personality traits, corporate distrust, and general trust) predicted attitudes towards {AI}. Introverts had more positive attitudes towards {AI} overall, likely because of algorithm appreciation. Conscientiousness and agreeableness were associated with forgiving attitudes towards negative aspects of {AI}. Higher corporate distrust led to negative attitudes towards {AI} overall, while higher general trust led to positive views of the benefits of {AI}. The dissociation between general trust and corporate distrust may reflect the public’s attributions of the benefits and drawbacks of {AI}.

Through this, we observe humans who embrace technological advances with a positive attitude. Others, however, are particularly sceptical and claim to foresee substantial problems arising from such uses of technology. The aim of the present study was to introduce a short measure to assess the Attitude Towards Artificial Intelligence ({ATAI} scale) in the German, Chinese, and English languages. Participants from Germany (N = 461; 345 females), China (N = 413; 145 females), and the {UK} (N = 84; 65 females) completed the {ATAI} scale, for which the factorial structure was tested and compared between the samples. Participants from Germany and China were additionally asked about their willingness to interact with/use self-driving cars, Siri, Alexa, the social robot Pepper, and the humanoid robot Erica, which are representatives of popular artificial intelligence products. The results showed that the five-item {ATAI} scale comprises two negatively associated factors assessing (1) acceptance and (2) fear of artificial intelligence. The factor structure was found to be similar across the German, Chinese, and {UK} samples. Additionally, the {ATAI} scale was validated, as the items on the willingness to use specific artificial intelligence products were positively associated with the {ATAI} Acceptance scale and negatively with the {ATAI} Fear scale, in both the German and Chinese samples. In conclusion we introduce a short, reliable, and valid measure on the attitude towards artificial intelligence in German, Chinese, and English language.},

Because of the hidden and carrying capacity of Botnet, the detection task has become a real challenge. Different methodologies have been applied for finding the source of Botnet at an early stage. Machine Learning and Deep Learning have greatly impacted these Botnet detection methodologies. But still, it is a difficult task because of the lesser number of features available in the Botnet datasets. In this paper, we have proposed a Fuzzy Logic based feature engineering method. The proposed method first identifies the fuzzy elements in the dataset and then generates fuzzy sets. The features generated using this method is used by an Artificial Neural Network for classification of Botnet. To train and evaluate the {ANN} model, we have used the {CTU}-13 dataset. The proposed feature engineering method and Botnet classification method has performed well with an accuracy of 99.94\%. Still this method needs to be tested on different datasets. In future, new fuzzy rules can also be made to generate a new set of features as well as these rules can be used to generate features from other datasets.},

State-of-the-art approaches generally leverage the topological structure of the Twittersphere, while they neglect the heterogeneity of relations and influence among users. In this paper, we propose a novel bot detection framework to alleviate this problem, which leverages the topological structure of user-formed heterogeneous graphs and models varying influence intensity between users. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous information network with users as nodes and diversified relations as edges. We then propose relational graph transformers to model heterogeneous influence between users and learn node representations. Finally, we use semantic attention networks to aggregate messages across users and relations and conduct heterogeneity-aware Twitter bot detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive Twitter bot detection benchmark. Additional studies also bear out the effectiveness of our proposed relational graph transformers, semantic attention networks and the graph-based approach in general.},

The detection of bots has been a major task within the field of social media computation, and many datasets and bot detection algorithms have been developed. With these algorithms, the bot score stability is key in estimating the impact of bots on the diffusion of information. Within several experiments on Twitter agents, we quantify the amount of data required for consistent bot predictions and analyze agent bot classification behavior. Through this study, we developed a methodology to establish parameters for stabilizing the bot probability score through threshold, temporal and volume analysis, eventually quantifying suitable threshold values for bot classification (i.e. whether the agent is a bot or not) and reasonable data collection size (i.e. number of days of tweets or number of tweets) for stable scores and bot classification.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the Internet has enabled access to widespread remote services in the distributed computing environment; however, integrity of data transmission in the distributed computing platform is hindered by a number of security issues. For instance, the botnet phenomenon is a prominent threat to Internet security, including the threat of malicious codes. The botnet phenomenon supports a wide range of criminal activities, including distributed denial of service ({DDoS}) attacks, click fraud, phishing, malware distribution, spam emails, and building machines for illegitimate exchange of information/materials. Therefore, it is imperative to design and develop a robust mechanism for improving the botnet detection, analysis, and removal process. Currently, botnet detection techniques have been reviewed in different ways; however, such studies are limited in scope and lack discussions on the latest botnet detection techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the latest state-of-the-art techniques for botnet detection and figures out the trends of previous and current research. It provides a thematic taxonomy for the classification of botnet detection techniques and highlights the implications and critical aspects by qualitatively analyzing such techniques. Related to our comprehensive review, we highlight future directions for improving the schemes that broadly span the entire botnet detection research field and identify the persistent and prominent research challenges that remain open.},

	abstract = {The problem of detecting bots, automated social media accounts governed by software but disguising as human users, has strong implications. For example, bots have been used to sway political elections by distorting online discourse, to manipulate the stock market, or to push anti-vaccine conspiracy theories that may have caused health epidemics. Most techniques proposed to date detect bots at the account level, by processing large amounts of social media posts, and leveraging information from network structure, temporal dynamics, sentiment analysis, etc. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based on contextual long short-term memory ({LSTM}) architecture that exploits both content and metadata to detect bots at the tweet level: contextual features are extracted from user metadata and fed as auxiliary input to {LSTM} deep nets processing the tweet text. Another contribution that we make is proposing a technique based on synthetic minority oversampling to generate a large labeled dataset, suitable for deep nets training, from a minimal amount of labeled data (roughly 3000 examples of sophisticated Twitter bots). We demonstrate that, from just one single tweet, our architecture can achieve high classification accuracy ({AUC}  {\textgreater}  96\%) in separating bots from humans. We apply the same architecture to account-level bot detection, achieving nearly perfect classification accuracy ({AUC}  {\textgreater}  99\%). Our system outperforms previous state of the art while leveraging a small and interpretable set of features, yet requiring minimal training data.},

In contrast, the ritual model illustrates the reinforcement of racist attitudes and disparate treatment of minorities that occurs with the repetitive use of hate speech. Although the ritual model serves a heuristic function by providing courts with a framework for understanding harm caused by hate speech, its judicial adoption to determine liability for individual instances of racist or sexist communication raises troublesome First Amendment issues},

The presence of hate speech online is becoming increasingly problematic, making necessary the development of appropriate countermeasures. In this work, we perform hate speech detection on a corpus of more than one million comments on {YouTube} videos through a machine learning model, trained and fine-tuned on a large set of hand-annotated data. Our analysis shows that there is no evidence of the presence of “pure haters”, meant as active users posting exclusively hateful comments. Moreover, coherently with the echo chamber hypothesis, we find that users skewed towards one of the two categories of video channels (questionable, reliable) are more prone to use inappropriate, violent, or hateful language within their opponents’ community. Interestingly, users loyal to reliable sources use on average a more toxic language than their counterpart. Finally, we find that the overall toxicity of the discussion increases with its length, measured both in terms of the number of comments and time. Our results show that, coherently with Godwin’s law, online debates tend to degenerate towards increasingly toxic exchanges of views.},

	abstract = {Toxic language detection systems often falsely flag text that contains minority group mentions as toxic, as those groups are often the targets of online hate. Such over-reliance on spurious correlations also causes systems to struggle with detecting implicitly toxic language. To help mitigate these issues, we create {ToxiGen}, a new large-scale and machine-generated dataset of 274k toxic and benign statements about 13 minority groups. We develop a demonstration-based prompting framework and an adversarial classifier-in-the-loop decoding method to generate subtly toxic and benign text with a massive pretrained language model. Controlling machine generation in this way allows {ToxiGen} to cover implicitly toxic text at a larger scale, and about more demographic groups, than previous resources of human-written text. We conduct a human evaluation on a challenging subset of {ToxiGen} and find that annotators struggle to distinguish machine-generated text from human-written language. We also find that 94.5\% of toxic examples are labeled as hate speech by human annotators. Using three publicly-available datasets, we show that finetuning a toxicity classifier on our data improves its performance on human-written data substantially. We also demonstrate that {ToxiGen} can be used to fight machine-generated toxicity as finetuning improves the classifier significantly on our evaluation subset.

The undemanding access to the enormous amount of information being generated on these platforms has led people to post and react with toxic content that originates violence. Though efforts have been made toward detecting and restraining such content online, it is still challenging to identify it accurately. Deep learning based solutions have been at the forefront of identifying hateful content. However, the factors such as the context-dependent nature of hate speech, the intention of the user, undesired biases, etc. make this process overcritical. In this work, we deeply explore a wide range of challenges in automatic hate speech detection by presenting a hierarchical organization of these problems. We focus on challenges faced by machine learning or deep learning based solutions to hate speech identification. At the top level, we distinguish between data level, model level, and human level challenges. We further provide an exhaustive analysis of each level of the hierarchy with examples.

This paper systematically reviews textual hate speech detection systems and highlights their primary datasets, textual features, and machine learning models. The results of this literature review are integrated with content analysis, resulting in several themes for 138 relevant papers. This study shows several approaches that do not provide consistent results in various hate speech categories. The most dominant sets of methods combine more than one deep learning model. Moreover, the analysis of several hate speech datasets shows that many datasets are small in size and are not reliable for various tasks of hate speech detection.

In this paper, we provide a background to the concept of empathy, and how it factors into learning. We then present our approach to equipping a robotic tutor with several empathic qualities, describing the technical architecture and its components, a map-reading learning scenario developed for an interactive multitouch table, as well as the pedagogical and empathic strategies devised for the robot. We also describe the results of a pilot study comparing the robotic tutor with these empathic qualities against a version of the tutor without them. The pilot study was performed with 26 school children aged 10–11 at their school. Results revealed that children in the test condition indeed rated the robot as more empathic than children in the control condition. Moreover, we explored several related measures, such as relational status and learning effect, yet no other significant differences were found. We further discuss these results and provide insights into future directions.},

	abstract = {Empathy plays a fundamental role in building relationships. To foster close relationships and lasting engagements between humans and robots, empathy models can provide direct clues into how it can be done. In this study, we focus on capturing in a quantitative way indicators of early empathy realization between a human and a robot using a process that encompasses affective attachment, trust, expectations and reflecting on the other’s perspective within a set of collaborative strategies. We hypothesize that an active collaboration strategy is conducive to a more meaningful and purposeful engagement of realizing empathy between a human and a robot compared to a passive one. With a deliberate design, the interaction with the robot was presented as a maze game where a human and a robot must collaborate in order to reach the goal using two strategies: one maintaining control individually taking turns (passive strategy) and the other one where both must agree on their next move based on reflection and argumentation. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the pilot study confirmed that a general sense of closeness with the robot was perceived when applying the active strategy. Regarding the specific indicators of empathy realization: (1) affective attachment, affective emulation was equally present throughout the experiment in both conditions, and thus, no conclusion could be reached; (2) trust, quantitative analysis partially supported the hypothesis that an active collaborative strategy will promote teamwork attitudes, where the human is open to the robot’s suggestions and to act as a teammate; and (3) regulating expectation, quantitative analysis confirmed that a collaborative strategy promoted a discovery process that regulates the subject’s expectation toward the robot. Overall, we can conclude that an active collaborative strategy impacts favorably the process of realizing empathy compared to a passive one. The results are compelling to move the design of this experiment forward into more comprehensive studies, ultimately leading to a path where we can clearly study engagements that reduce abandonment and disillusionment with the process of realizing empathy as the core design for active collaborative strategies.},

It has been claimed that companies need to keep track of only their individual {NPSs} and this one number would determine customer loyalty and the growth rate of the companies. Several academicians and researchers have argued about the validity of {NPS} as the only factor that determines the company growth rates. The analysis of {NPS} can be done from both empirical perspective and conceptual perspective. An analysis of {NPS} from the conceptual perspective based on Reichheld's original paper has been attempted. It is evident from the analysis that {NPS} only gives a particular direction to increase the company growth rate and is not the only factor that determines it. Several other factors might be there that influence the company growth rate.},

A popular method to perform the user acceptance testing is the usability testing, which in this method, the result provides the indication of the essential quality for the client to decide whether to approve or to deny the product. In this research of paper, we are going to do the usability testing by utilizing the System Usability Scale technique and the Net Promoter Score technique to measure appropriateness of the population information systems in the city of Tegal while we are also finding optimum testers required using the sampling technique. The result we earn trough this research is according to the Usability Testing result the proposed system developed by researchers is better than the current running system and the total testers participating on system testing is able to optimize using the sampling method.},

	abstract = {Valid measurement scales for predicting user acceptance of computers are in short supply. Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},

Our research traced the link between system experience and ease of use via both positive (computer playfulness) and negative (computer anxiety) responses using a sample of 116 users of electronic spreadsheets. As expected, system experience was significantly related to perceived ease of use. Both computer playfulness and computer anxiety were found to be significant mediators of the effect that system experience has on ease of use. However, the effect was fully mediated only by computer anxiety, revealing that the negative side of user reaction is a more potent mechanism than the positive side. Moreover, the findings indicate that those interventions found to influence the mediating variable of computer anxiety should be used to effectively enhance ease of use perceptions.},

	abstract = {When it comes to evaluating online information experiences, what metrics matter? We conducted a study in which 30 people browsed and selected content within an online news website. Data collected included psychometric scales (User Engagement, Cognitive Absorption, System Usability Scales), self-reported interest in news content, and performance metrics (i.e., reading time, browsing time, total time, number of pages visited, and use of recommended links); a subset of the participants had their physiological responses recorded during the interaction (i.e., heart rate, electrodermal activity, electrocmytogram). Findings demonstrated the concurrent validity of the psychometric scales and interest ratings and revealed that increased time on tasks, number of pages visited, and use of recommended links were not necessarily indicative of greater self-reported engagement, cognitive absorption, or perceived usability. Positive ratings of news content were associated with lower physiological activity. The implications of this research are twofold. First, we propose that user experience is a useful framework for studying online information interactions and will result in a broader conceptualization of information interaction and its evaluation. Second, we advocate a mixed-methods approach to measurement that employs a suite of metrics capable of capturing the pragmatic (e.g., usability) and hedonic (e.g., fun, engagement) aspects of information interactions. We underscore the importance of using multiple measures in information research, because our results emphasize that performance and physiological data must be interpreted in the context of users' subjective experiences.},

It can be divided into the following three subcomponents: (i) the central executive, which is assumed to be an attentional-controlling system, is important in skills such as chess playing and is particularly susceptible to the effects of Alzheimer's disease; and two slave systems, namely (ii) the visuospatial sketch pad, which manipulates visual images and (iii) the phonological loop, which stores and rehearses speech-based information and is necessary for the acquisition of both native and second-language vocabulary.},

	abstract = {Objective: To describe and discuss the process used to write a narrative review of the literature for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Publication of narrative overviews of the literature should be standardized to increase their objectivity. Background: In the past decade numerous changes in research methodology pertaining to reviews of the literature have occurred. These changes necessitate authors of review articles to be familiar with current standards in the publication process. Methods: Narrative overview of the literature synthesizing the findings of literature retrieved from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts. Discussion: An overview of the use of three types of reviews of the literature is presented. Step by step instructions for how to conduct and write a narrative overview utilizing a 'best-evidence synthesis' approach are discussed, starting with appropriate preparatory work and ending with how to create proper illustrations. Several resources for creating reviews of the literature are presented and a narrative overview critical appraisal worksheet is included. A bibliography of other useful reading is presented in an appendix. Conclusion: Narrative overviews can be a valuable contribution to the literature if prepared properly. New and experienced authors wishing to write a narrative overview should find this article useful in constructing such a paper and carrying out the research process. It is hoped that this article will stimulate scholarly dialog amongst colleagues about this research design and other complex literature review methods. ?? 2006 National University of Health Sciences.},

We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, {XGBoost} scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

This paper investigates an asynchronous and fully online introductory statistics course with a collaboration component (Collaborative Keys). This study evaluates how students use these and other resources, if they are being used as intended, and how the use is related to performance. We extend the educational analytics literature and introduce a new measure to quantify how students transition between resources, and we evaluate how these transitions differ by student performance over the course of an entire term. The results suggest that the use of course’s resources is related to student achievement, with higher performing students focusing on video-related resources and showing more consistency and effectiveness in their use of resources throughout the term.},

The consequences of this problem include the danger that readers and reviewers will reach the wrong conclusion about what the evidence shows, leading at times to the use of unsafe or ineffective treatments. The role of meta-analysis in highlighting the existence of publication bias is explained, after which a brief summary of the evidence that publication bias exists in the biomedical trials literature is provided. In addition to “classic” publication bias (bias due to selection on the basis of statistical significance), other potential information suppression mechanisms that represent a threat to the validity of research reviews are explained, including language, citation, availability, cost, outcome, and duplication biases. After this, ways of preventing publication bias are introduced, including universal prospective registration of trials, and design of prospective meta-analyses. The role of thorough information search in reducing the impact of publication bias on meta-analytic results is explained, and suggestions of what to search are made. The major procedures for assessing publication bias are summarized, including file drawer (failsafe N) analysis, the funnel plot, the Begg and Mazumdar test, the Egger test, and the trim and fill method. Differences in the various procedures' specific hypotheses about the distribution of study results as well as their limitations are noted. Finally, results of surveys of the impact of publication bias on health-care meta-analysis are described and their implications discussed.},

Die Bedeutung des Rasch-Modells für die Testkonstruktion steht zwar außer Frage, trotzdem ist auf gewisse Probleme bei der Analyse eines Itempools nach dem Rasch-Modell hinzuweisen. Zum ersten kann es Itempools geben, die dem Rasch-Modell widersprechen und trotzdem testtheoretisch brauchbar sind: Es können die Items annähernd einer sog. Guttman-Skala folgen oder sie entsprechen dem 2- bzw. 3-{PL} Modell von Birnbaum. Zum zweiten geht es im Zusammenhang mit Modelltests um die “α-Überhöhung“ bzw. das Konzept der Effektgrößen: Entweder werden zu viele Modelltests durchgeführt oder es werden Modelltests bestimmt, die hinsichtlich des Effekts zwar signifikant, aber inhaltlich irrelevant sind. In Ermangelung eines methodisch fundierten Regelwerks, welche Modelltests standardmäßig im Sinne eines state of the art durchzuführen sind, um gegebenenfalls den Grad der Bewährung des Rasch-Modells für einen bestimmten Itempool als ausreichend qualifizieren zu können, wird hier ein Vorschlag gemacht.},

If two different groups of examinees have different underlying multidimensional ability distributions and the test items are capable of discriminating among levels of abilities on these multiple dimensions, then any unidimensional scoring scheme has the potential to produce item bias. It is the purpose of this article to provide the testing practitioner with insight about the difference between item bias and item impact and how they relate to item validity. These concepts will be explained from a multidimensional item response theory ({MIRT}) perspective. Two detection procedures, the Mantel-Haenszel (as modified by Holland and Thayer, 1988) and Shealy and Stout's Simultaneous Item Bias ({SIB}; 1991) strategies, will be used to illustrate how practitioners can detect item bias.},

But more than surprising us, errors in statistical thinking, Downey shows, can have a huge impact. Statistical confusion has led to incorrect patient prognoses, caused mistakes in predicting disasters like earthquakes, hurt vaccination programs, hindered social justice efforts, and led to dubious policy decisions. Written for those who may have once taken a statistics course, but now forget almost everything they've learned, the book includes a diversity of examples that use real data and have real world impacts.

Thus, this systematic review presents findings on a) the prevalence of hate speech among children and adolescents and on hate speech definitions that guide prevalence assessments for this population; and b) the theoretical and empirical overlap of hate speech with related concepts. This review was guided by the Cochrane approach. To be included, publications were required to deal with real-life experiences of hate speech, to provide empirical data on prevalence for samples aged 5 to 21 years and they had to be published in academic formats. Included publications were full-text coded using two raters (κ = .80) and their quality was assessed. The string-guided electronic search ({ERIC}, {SocInfo}, Psycinfo, Psyndex) yielded 1,850 publications. Eighteen publications based on 10 studies met the inclusion criteria and their findings were systematized. Twelve publications were of medium quality due to minor deficiencies in their theoretical or methodological foundations. All studies used samples of adolescents and none of younger children. Nine out of 10 studies applied quantitative methodologies. Eighteen publications based on 10 studies were included. Results showed that frequencies for hate speech exposure were higher than those related to victimization and perpetration. Definitions of hate speech and assessment instruments were heterogeneous. Empirical evidence for an often theorized overlap between hate speech and bullying was found. The paper concludes by presenting a definition of hate speech, including implications for practice, policy, and research.},

To what extent does scholarship draw on critical race perspectives to interrogate how systemic racism is (re)produced on social media? What are the primary methodological and ethical challenges of the field? The article finds a lack of geographical and platform diversity, an absence of researchers’ reflexive dialogue with their object of study, and little engagement with critical race perspectives to unpack racism on social media.

This research is extended to determine the debates, lines of work of greatest interest, and the theories elaborated. The legal literature is intended to define hate speech and hate crime for the purposes of applying criminal sanctions. From the communication standpoint, the analysis of hate speech in the media is key to understanding the type of message used, its emitter, the way in which the message rallies supporters, and how they interpret the message. Spanish studies mostly fall within the legal area, in which they focus on cases of insult directed at the Catholic religion. We discuss the importance of interdisciplinarity and transversality and propose a mapping of hate speech that lends itself to comparisons between countries to assess measures to counteract their effects.},

	abstract = {High quality up-to-date systematic reviews are essential in order to help healthcare practitioners and researchers keep up-to-date with a large and rapidly growing body of evidence. Systematic reviews answer pre-defined research questions using explicit, reproducible methods to identify, critically appraise and combine results of primary research studies. Key stages in the production of systematic reviews include clarification of aims and methods in a protocol, finding relevant research, collecting data, assessing study quality, synthesizing evidence, and interpreting findings. Systematic reviews may address different types of questions, such as questions about effectiveness of interventions, diagnostic test accuracy, prognosis, prevalence or incidence of disease, accuracy of measurement instruments, or qualitative data. For all reviews, it is important to define criteria such as the population, intervention, comparison and outcomes, and to identify potential risks of bias. Reviews of the effect of rehabilitation interventions or reviews of data from observational studies, diagnostic test accuracy, or qualitative data may be more methodologically challenging than reviews of effectiveness of drugs for the prevention or treatment of stroke. Challenges in reviews of stroke rehabilitation can include poor definition of complex interventions, use of outcome measures that have not been validated, and poor generalizability of results. There may also be challenges with bias because the effects are dependent on the persons delivering the intervention, and because masking of participants and investigators may not be possible. There are a wide range of resources which can support the planning and completion of systematic reviews, and these should be considered when planning a systematic review relating to stroke.},

	abstract = {Linear regression analyses commonly involve two consecutive stages of statistical inquiry. In the first stage, a single ‘best’ model is defined by a specific selection of relevant predictors; in the second stage, the regression coefficients of the winning model are used for prediction and for inference concerning the importance of the predictors. However, such second-stage inference ignores the model uncertainty from the first stage, resulting in overconfident parameter estimates that generalize poorly. These drawbacks can be overcome by model averaging, a technique that retains all models for inference, weighting each model’s contribution by its posterior probability. Although conceptually straightforward, model averaging is rarely used in applied research, possibly due to the lack of easily accessible software. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we provide a tutorial on linear regression using Bayesian model averaging in {JASP}, based on the {BAS} package in R. Firstly, we provide theoretical background on linear regression, Bayesian inference, and Bayesian model averaging. Secondly, we demonstrate the method on an example data set from the World Happiness Report. Lastly, we discuss limitations of model averaging and directions for dealing with violations of model assumptions.},

The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution. The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events. This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated {WAMBS} (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist.

	abstract = {Throughout the last two decades, Bayesian statistical methods have proliferated throughout ecology and evolution. Numerous previous references established both philosophical and computational guidelines for implementing Bayesian methods. However, protocols for incorporating prior information, the defining characteristic of Bayesian philosophy, are nearly nonexistent in the ecological literature. Here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors in ecology and evolution by providing a ‘consumer's guide’ to weakly informative priors. The first section outlines three reasons why ecologists should abandon noninformative priors: 1) common flat priors are not always noninformative, 2) noninformative priors provide the same result as simpler frequentist methods, and 3) noninformative priors suffer from the same high type I and type M error rates as frequentist methods. The second section provides a guide for implementing informative priors, wherein I detail convenient ‘reference’ prior distributions for common statistical models (i.e. regression, {ANOVA}, hierarchical models). I then use simulations to visually demonstrate how informative priors influence posterior parameter estimates. With the guidelines provided here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors for Bayesian analyses in ecology. Ecologists can and should debate the appropriate form of prior information, but should consider weakly informative priors as the new ‘default’ prior for any Bayesian model.},

Data are available from the first author, code for the program Mplus is provided, and tables illustrate how to present Bayesian results.

Dieser Artikel zeigt, dass deutsche Nachkriegskohorten sich kaum in ihren Einstellungen unterscheiden, weder in Bezug auf Lebensziele noch in Bezug auf Sorgen oder gesellschaftliches und politisches Engagement. Diese Kohorteneffekte werden unter Kontrolle von Alters- und Periodeneffekten mit bis zu 551.664 Beobachtungen von bis zu 76.161 Individuen des Sozio-oekonomischen Panels berechnet. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass von der Literatur postulierte Generationsunterschiede zwischen der sogenannten Generation Y, X, den Babyboomern, den ’68ern sowie der sogenannten Skeptischen Nachkriegsgeneration in Wirklichkeit kaum existieren. Weithin verbreitete Vorstellungen, wie Generationen sich in ihren Einstellungen unterscheiden, finden sich somit empirisch nicht bestätigt. Angesichts dessen sind Umfragen wie die Shell Jugendstudie wenig sinnvoll, ebenso wie eine Managementliteratur, die Ratschläge zum Umgang mit Generationenunterschieden gibt, welche empirisch nicht feststellbar sind.},

In this article, we aim to achieve two goals that are targeted at answering the broad question: “What accounts for the ubiquity of generations despite a lack of evidence for their existence and impact?” First, we explore and “bust” ten common myths about the science and practice of generations and generational differences. Second, with these debunked myths as a backdrop, we focus on two alternative and complementary frameworks—the social constructionist perspective and the lifespan development perspective—with promise for changing the way we think about age, aging, and generations at work. We argue that the social constructionist perspective offers important opportunities for understanding the persistence and pervasiveness of generations and that, as an alternative to studying generations, the lifespan perspective represents a better model for understanding how age operates and development unfolds at work. Overall, we urge stakeholders in organizational science and practice (e.g., students, researchers, consultants, managers) to adopt more nuanced perspectives grounded in these models, rather than a generational perspective, to understand the influence of age and aging at work.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Heart rate variability ({HRV}) is characterised by a variety of linear, non-linear, periodical and non-periodical oscillations. The aim of the present study was mainly to investigate the role played by neural mechanisms in determining non-linear and non-periodical components.
{METHODS}: Analysis was performed in 7 recently heart transplanted patients and in 7 controls of similar age whose {HRV} signal was collected during 24 h. Parameters that quantify non-linear dynamic behaviour, in a time series, were calculated. We first assessed the specific non-linear nature of the time series by a test on surrogate data after Fourier phase randomization. Furthermore, the D2 correlation dimension, K2 Kolmogorov entropy, and H self-similarity exponent of the signal were estimated. From this last parameter, the dimension D = 1/H can be obtained. In order to assess whether the dynamics of the system are compatible with chaotic characteristics, the entire spectrum of Lyapunov exponents was calculated. We used return maps to graphically represent the non-linear and non-periodical behaviours in patients and controls.
{RESULTS}: Surrogate data suggest that the {HRV} time courses have unique non-linear characteristics. D2, K2 and 1/H parameters were significantly lower in transplanted subjects than in controls. Positivity of the first Lyapunov exponent indicates divergence of trajectories in state-space. Furthermore, the display of return maps on projections obtained after Singular Value Decomposition, especially in low-complexity data (as in transplanted patients), shows a structure which is suggestive of a strange attractor. These findings support the hypothesis that chaotic dynamics underlie {HRV}.
{CONCLUSION}: These results indicate that non-linear dynamics are likely to be present in {HRV} control mechanisms, giving rise to complex and qualitatively different behaviours. System complexity decreases in transplanted patients and this may be related to loss of the neural modulation of heart rate.},

The growing prosperity of the West German “economic miracle” of the 1950s served a psychosocial “filling function” to block the narcissistic damage caused by confrontation with past crimes and the sense of the nation’s loss of greatness. As this prosperity vanishes for many people during the current economic crisis, the filling comes out and the narcissistic wound opens up. What emerges is both what lies underneath and what has been serving as a defense against it, which involve authoritarian dynamics. Initially, the metaphor of “narcissistic filling” will be developed through our analysis of group discussions conducted as part of our qualitative study (of 2008). The developed hypotheses will thereafter be introduced to our following representative survey (of 2010) and confirmed by means of quantitative methods.},

Ignoring defaults is not a sound option for marketers or consumer policy makers. The authors identify three theoretical causes of default effects--implied endorsement, cognitive biases, and effort--to guide thought on the appropriate marketer and policy maker responses to the issues posed for consumer welfare and consumer autonomy, including proposals for benign "nudges" of behavior. Defaults can be a preferred form of decision architecture; that is, other nonconscious influences on choice and an absence of established preferences can mean that active choice is not always the better alternative. The authors propose "smart defaults" as welfare-enhancing and market-oriented alternatives to the current practice of generally ignoring default effects. Their analysis highlights the importance of considering the process as well as the outcomes of consumer decision making and taking responsibility for consumers' mistakes arising from misuse of defaults. The authors conclude by reflecting on the ethical and policy implications of techniques that influence consumer choice without awareness.

The authors expand Novemsky and Kahneman's summary by exploring two critical constructs that help define the boundaries of loss aversion: emotional attachment and cognitive perspective. Emotional attachment alters loss aversion by moderating the degree to which parting with an item involves a loss, whereas shifts in cognitive perspective explain why items typically viewed as a loss are given more or less weight. The goal is to use these constructs to characterize more specifically contexts in which losses loom larger than gains and to suggest specific ways that research into loss aversion could evolve.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

These assumptions include but not limited to properly accounting for two important sources of bias: confounding and selection bias. While not adjusting the causal association for an intermediate variable will yield an unbiased estimate of the exposure-outcome’s total causal effect, it is often that obstetricians will want to adjust for an intermediate variable to assess if the intermediate is the underlying driver of the association. Such a practice must be weighed in light of the underlying research question, and whether such an adjustment is necessary should be carefully considered. Gestational age is, by far, the most commonly encountered variable in obstetrics that is often mislabeled as a confounder when, in fact, it may be an intermediate. If, indeed, gestational age is an intermediate but if mistakenly labeled as a confounding variable and consequently adjusted in an analysis, the conclusions can be unexpected. The implications of this over adjustment of an intermediate as though it were a confounder can render an otherwise persuasive study downright meaningless.

	abstract = {Background
Directed acyclic graphs ({DAGs}) are an increasingly popular approach for identifying confounding variables that require conditioning when estimating causal effects. This review examined the use of {DAGs} in applied health research to inform recommendations for improving their transparency and utility in future research.

Methods
Original health research articles published during 1999–2017 mentioning ‘directed acyclic graphs’ (or similar) or citing {DAGitty} were identified from Scopus, Web of Science, Medline and Embase. Data were extracted on the reporting of: estimands, {DAGs} and adjustment sets, alongside the characteristics of each article’s largest {DAG}.

Results
A total of 234 articles were identified that reported using {DAGs}. A fifth (n = 48, 21\%) reported their target estimand(s) and half (n = 115, 48\%) reported the adjustment set(s) implied by their {DAG}(s). Two-thirds of the articles (n = 144, 62\%) made at least one {DAG} available. {DAGs} varied in size but averaged 12 nodes [interquartile range ({IQR}): 9–16, range: 3–28] and 29 arcs ({IQR}: 19–42, range: 3–99). The median saturation (i.e. percentage of total possible arcs) was 46\% ({IQR}: 31–67, range: 12–100). 37\% (n = 53) of the {DAGs} included unobserved variables, 17\% (n = 25) included ‘super-nodes’ (i.e. nodes containing more than one variable) and 34\% (n = 49) were visually arranged so that the constituent arcs flowed in the same direction (e.g. top-to-bottom).

Conclusion
There is substantial variation in the use and reporting of {DAGs} in applied health research. Although this partly reflects their flexibility, it also highlights some potential areas for improvement. This review hence offers several recommendations to improve the reporting and use of {DAGs} in future research.},

	abstract = {Background
The findings of observational studies can be distorted by a number of factors. So-called confounders are well known, but distortion by collider bias ({CB}) has received little attention in medical research to date. The goal of this article is to present the principle of {CB}, and measures that can be taken to avoid it, by way of a few illustrative examples.

Methods
The findings of a selective review of the literature on {CB} are explained with illustrative examples.

Results
The simplest case of a collider variable is one that is caused by at least two other variables. An example of {CB} is the observation that, among persons with diabetes, obesity is associated with lower mortality, even though it is associated with higher mortality in the general population. The false protective association between obesity and mortality arises from the restriction of the study population to persons with diabetes.

Conclusion
{CB} is a distortion that arises through restriction on or stratification by a collider variable, or through statistical adjustment for a collider variable in a regression model. {CB} can arise in many ways. The graphic representation of causal structures helps to identify potential sources of {CB}. It is important to distinguish confounders from colliders, as methods that serve to correct for confounding can themselves cause bias when applied to colliders. There is no generally applicable method for correcting {CB}.},

Software that adops tidyverse principles shares both a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so learning one piece of the ecosystem makes it easier to learn the next. You'll understand why the tidymodels framework has been built to be used by a broad range of people},

Later, these guidelines were approved by the {ITC} for distribution to national psychological societies, test publishers, and researchers.},

The {OASIS} images were collected from online sources, and valence and arousal ratings were obtained in an online study (total N = 822). The valence and arousal ratings covered much of the circumplex space and were highly reliable and consistent across gender groups. {OASIS} has four advantages: (a) the stimulus set contains a large number of images in four categories; (b) the data were collected in 2015, and thus {OASIS} features more current images and reflects more current ratings of valence and arousal than do existing stimulus sets; (c) the {OASIS} database affords users the ability to interactively explore images by category and ratings; and, most critically, (d) {OASIS} allows for free use of the images in online and offline research studies, as they are not subject to the copyright restrictions that apply to the International Affective Picture System. The {OASIS} images, along with normative valence and arousal ratings, are available for download from www.benedekkurdi.com/\#oasisor https://db.tt/{yYTZYCga}.},

Das Buch hier versteht sich als Einführung in Programmierkonzepte; Leser*innen werden angeleitet, über Sprachkonstrukte nachzudenken und Problemlösungsstrategien zu entwickeln. Ziel ist die Entwicklung der Fähigkeit, mit mathematischen Objekten zu arbeiten. Ein besonderer Schwerpunkt wird auf Debugging-Techniken gelegt, um Syntax-, Laufzeit- und Semantikfehler zu beheben. Jedes Kapitel endet mit einem eigenen Absatz "Debugging". Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt liegt bei Verständnistests und kleineren Projekten, an denen Programmierkonzepte gleich ausprobiert werden können.

This tutorial will provide a high-level synthesis of the main embedding techniques in {NLP}, in the broad sense. We will start by conventional word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec and {GloVe}) and then move to other types of embeddings, such as sense-specific and graph alternatives. We will finalize with an overview of the trending contextualized representations (e.g., {ELMo} and {BERT}) and explain their potential and impact in {NLP}.},

Because of this, extracting information from text data sets requires attention to methods, techniques, and approaches.'Python Text Mining' includes a number of application cases, demonstrations, and approaches that will help you deepen your understanding of feature extraction from data sets. You will get an understanding of good information retrieval, a critical step in accomplishing many machine learning tasks. We will learn to classify text into discrete segments solely on the basis of model properties, not on the basis of user-supplied criteria. The book will walk you through many methodologies, such as classification, that will enable you to rapidly construct recommendation engines, subject segmentation, and sentiment analysis applications. Toward the end, we will also look at machine translation and transfer learning.By the end of this book, you'll know exactly how to gather web-based text, process it, and then apply it to the development of {NLP} applications.What you will learn● Practice how to process raw data and transform it into a usable format.● Best techniques to convert text to vectors and then transform into word embeddings.● Unleash {ML} and {DL} techniques to perform sentiment analysis.● Build modern recommendation engines using classification techniques.Who this book is {forThis} book is a good place to start with examples, explanations, and exercises for anyone interested in learning more about advanced text mining and natural language processing techniques. It is suggested but not required that you have some prior programming experience.Table of Contents1. Basic Text Processing Techniques2. Text to Numbers3. Word Embeddings4. Topic Modeling5.

Watch: {MIT}’s Deep Learning State of the Art lecture referencing this post

In the previous post, we looked at Attention – a ubiquitous method in modern deep learning models. Attention is a concept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation applications. In this post, we will look at The Transformer – a model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained. The Transformer outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks. The biggest benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization. It is in fact Google Cloud’s recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use their Cloud {TPU} offering. So let’s try to break the model apart and look at how it functions.

The Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need. A {TensorFlow} implementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2Tensor package. Harvard’s {NLP} group created a guide annotating the paper with {PyTorch} implementation. In this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and introduce the concepts one by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.

2020 Update: I’ve created a “Narrated Transformer” video which is a gentler approach to the topic:




A High-Level Look
Let’s begin by looking at the model as a single black box. In a machine translation application, it would take a sentence in one language, and output its translation in another.},

The causal inference literature has not, however, produced a clear formal definition of a confounder, as it has given priority to the concept of confounding over that of a confounder. We consider a number of candidate definitions arising from various more informal statements made in the literature. We consider the properties satisfied by each candidate definition, principally focusing on (i) whether under the candidate definition control for all “confounders” suffices to control for “confounding” and (ii) whether each confounder in some context helps eliminate or reduce confounding bias. Several of the candidate definitions do not have these two properties. Only one candidate definition of those considered satisfies both properties. We propose that a “confounder” be defined as a pre-exposure covariate C for which there exists a set of other covariates X such that effect of the exposure on the outcome is unconfounded conditional on (X, C) but such that for no proper subset of (X, C) is the effect of the exposure on the outcome unconfounded given the subset. A variable that helps reduce bias but not eliminate bias we propose referring to as a “surrogate confounder.”},

They involve a comprehensive search to locate all relevant published and unpublished work on a subject; a systematic integration of search results; and a critique of the extent, nature, and quality of evidence in relation to a particular research question. The best reviews synthesize studies to draw broad theoretical conclusions about what a literature means, linking theory to evidence and evidence to theory. This guide describes how to plan, conduct, organize, and present a systematic review of quantitative (meta-analysis) or qualitative (narrative review, meta-synthesis) information. We outline core standards and principles and describe commonly encountered problems. Although this guide targets psychological scientists, its high level of abstraction makes it potentially relevant to any subject area or discipline. We argue that systematic reviews are a key methodology for clarifying whether and how research findings replicate and for explaining possible inconsistencies, and we call for researchers to conduct systematic reviews to help elucidate whether there is a replication crisis.},

	abstract = {The concepts of generations and generational differences have received much attention in the academic literature, in the popular press, and among practitioners, policymakers, and politicians. Despite the continued interest, research has failed to find convincing evidence for the existence of distinct generations, commonly conceptualized as broad groupings of birth cohorts (e.g., 1980–2000) that have been influenced by a set of significant events (e.g., economic depressions) and labeled with names and qualities that supposedly reflect their defining characteristics (e.g., Millennials). Further, any differences that have been found in empirical studies, and that have been attributed to generational membership, are more likely due to age and/or contemporaneous period effects. Nonetheless, some researchers, employers, institutions, governments, and many laypeople continue to treat generations like they are a powerful and actionable phenomenon. We address these issues in two ways. First, we review the science of generations, focusing on what is known, what is not, and why the evidence points to the conclusion that generations, as popularly conceptualized, do not exist in objectively quantifiable ways. We also address the disconnect between science and practice regarding generations. Second, we explore alternate explanations for effects that are attributed to generations and review approaches that are both more theoretically sound and empirically supported, including lifespan theory and social constructionist frameworks. Finally, we address connections between assumptions made about generations and concerns about diversity, equity, and inclusion at work. Specifically, we address what has been termed generationalism, the belief that members of specific generations possess unique, stereotypic characteristics.},

The effectiveness of {PowerPoint} Presentation ({PPT}) for teaching Technical Drawing concepts in Basic Technology was determined using a pretest-posttest, non-equivalent, non-randomized experimental group design. A 2x2x3 factorial design was employed. One hundred {JSS} 1 students (53 male and 47 female) categorized into 29 high, 54 medium and 17 low achievers from two secondary schools in Abuja Metropolis formed the sample. The schools were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group was taught some selected concepts from Technical Drawing using {PowerPoint} Presentation ({PPT}) while Chalkboard method ({CB}) was used for the control group. A validated Technical Drawing Achievement Test ({TDAT}) comprising a 25-item multiple-choice test was employed for data collection. The reliability coefficient of {TDAT} was 0.88 using Kuder-Richardson ({KR}-20). The hypotheses were tested using {ANCOVA} and Sidak post-hoc analysis. Results revealed that the students taught with {PPT} performed better than their counterparts taught with {CB}. Also, high achievers performed better than medium and low achievers respectfully. The {PPT} was found also to be gender friendly. Based on the findings, it was recommended that the use of {PPT} should be encouraged in Nigerian schools.},

Questions have been raised about the implications of the use of this new medium for knowledge dissemination. It is suggested {PowerPoint} supports a cognitive and pedagogical style inconsistent with both the development of higher analytical thinking skills and the acquisition of rich narrative and interpretive understanding. This paper examines how {PowerPoint} invites and seduces educators to reshape knowledge in particular ways, and subsequently how this knowledge is presented to students in the classroom. The particular forms of knowing, relating, and presenting with {PowerPoint} are decided in part by teacher habituation to the software tool’s default patterns, but also by the very nature of the presentation medium itself.},

Such a structure is made explicit within {PowerPoint} presentations and may even be amplified as {PowerPoint} invites the lecturer to reduce content to a bulleted format. Such linear sequences have been related to passive, surface approaches to learning. The application of concept‐mapping techniques can support the lecturer in making explicit the underlying expert structure of the information being presented to help the student to make the necessary transformations of knowledge structures that are required for meaningful learning. The authors suggest that {PowerPoint} provides a concrete arena in which lecturers can reflect upon the structure of knowledge that is being constructed within their classrooms.},

This shared task comprises three binary classification subtasks with the goal to identify: toxic comments, engaging comments, and comments that include indications of a need for fact-checking, here referred to as fact-claiming comments. Building on the two previous {GermEval} shared tasks on the identification of offensive language in 2018 and 2019, we extend this year's task definition to meet the demand of moderators and community managers to also highlight comments that foster respectful communication, encourage in-depth discussions, and check facts that lines of arguments rely on. The dataset comprises 4,188 posts extracted from the Facebook page of a German political talk show of a national public television broadcaster. A theoretical framework and additional reliability tests during the data annotation process ensure particularly high data quality. The shared task had 15 participating teams submitting 31 runs for the subtask on toxic comments, 25 runs for the subtask on engaging comments, and 31 for the subtask on fact-claiming comments.

Initially, {CSA} Illumina's coverage at journal title level appeared to be the most comprehensive. But when recall and average citation count was tested at article level and rankings extrapolated by submission frequency to individual journal titles, Scopus was ranked first. When issues of functionality, the quality of record processing and depth of coverage are taken into account, Scopus and Web of Science have a significant advantage over the other two databases.

We compared the content coverage and practical utility of {PubMed}, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The official Web pages of the databases were used to extract information on the range of journals covered, search facilities and restrictions, and update frequency. We used the example of a keyword search to evaluate the usefulness of these databases in biomedical information retrieval and a specific published article to evaluate their utility in performing citation analysis. All databases were practical in use and offered numerous search facilities. {PubMed} and Google Scholar are accessed for free. The keyword search with {PubMed} offers optimal update frequency and includes online early articles; other databases can rate articles by number of citations, as an index of importance. For citation analysis, Scopus offers about 20\% more coverage than Web of Science, whereas Google Scholar offers results of inconsistent accuracy. {PubMed} remains an optimal tool in biomedical electronic research. Scopus covers a wider journal range, of help both in keyword searching and citation analysis, but it is currently limited to recent articles (published after 1995) compared with Web of Science.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The role of evidence-based medicine in sports medicine and orthopaedic surgery is rapidly growing. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are also proliferating in the medical literature.
{PURPOSE}: To provide the outline necessary for a practitioner to properly understand and/or conduct a systematic review for publication in a sports medicine journal.
{STUDY} {DESIGN}: Review.
{METHODS}: The steps of a successful systematic review include the following: identification of an unanswered answerable question; explicit definitions of the investigation's participant(s), intervention(s), comparison(s), and outcome(s); utilization of {PRISMA} (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines and {PROSPERO} registration; thorough systematic data extraction; and appropriate grading of the evidence and strength of the recommendations.
{RESULTS}: An outline to understand and conduct a systematic review is provided, and the difference between meta-analyses and systematic reviews is described. The steps necessary to perform a systematic review are fully explained, including the study purpose, search methodology, data extraction, reporting of results, identification of bias, and reporting of the study's main findings.
{CONCLUSION}: Systematic reviews or meta-analyses critically appraise and formally synthesize the best existing evidence to provide a statement of conclusion that answers specific clinical questions. Readers and reviewers, however, must recognize that the quality and strength of recommendations in a review are only as strong as the quality of studies that it analyzes. Thus, great care must be used in the interpretation of bias and extrapolation of the review's findings to translation to clinical practice. Without advanced education on the topic, the reader may follow the steps discussed herein to perform a systematic review.},

	abstract = {This article provides a step-by-step approach to conducting and reporting systematic literature reviews ({SLRs}) in the domain of healthcare design and discusses some of the key quality issues associated with {SLRs}. {SLR}, as the name implies, is a systematic way of collecting, critically evaluating, integrating, and presenting findings from across multiple research studies on a research question or topic of interest. {SLR} provides a way to assess the quality level and magnitude of existing evidence on a question or topic of interest. It offers a broader and more accurate level of understanding than a traditional literature review. A systematic review adheres to standardized methodologies/guidelines in systematic searching, filtering, reviewing, critiquing, interpreting, synthesizing, and reporting of findings from multiple publications on a topic/domain of interest. The Cochrane Collaboration is the most well-known and widely respected global organization producing {SLRs} within the healthcare field and a standard to follow for any researcher seeking to write a transparent and methodologically sound {SLR}. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis ({PRISMA}), like the Cochrane Collaboration, was created by an international network of health-based collaborators and provides the framework for {SLR} to ensure methodological rigor and quality. The {PRISMA} statement is an evidence-based guide consisting of a checklist and flowchart intended to be used as tools for authors seeking to write {SLR} and meta-analyses.},

In response, this paper investigates 2,448,055 citations to 2,299 English-language highly-cited documents from 252 {GS} subject categories published in 2006, comparing {GS}, the {WoS} Core Collection, and Scopus. {GS} consistently found the largest percentage of citations across all areas (93\%-96\%), far ahead of Scopus (35\%-77\%) and {WoS} (27\%-73\%). {GS} found nearly all the {WoS} (95\%) and Scopus (92\%) citations. Most citations found only by {GS} were from non-journal sources (48\%-65\%), including theses, books, conference papers, and unpublished materials. Many were non-English (19\%-38\%), and they tended to be much less cited than citing sources that were also in Scopus or {WoS}. Despite the many unique {GS} citing sources, Spearman correlations between citation counts in {GS} and {WoS} or Scopus are high (0.78-0.99). They are lower in the Humanities, and lower between {GS} and {WoS} than between {GS} and Scopus. The results suggest that in all areas {GS} citation data is essentially a superset of {WoS} and Scopus, with substantial extra coverage.},

	abstract = {Cognitive aging reflects not only loss but also adaptation to loss. The adult brain is capable of plastic change, including change in cortical representation. This has been seen in association not only with frank lesions but also in healthy individuals as a function of experience and training. This review considers the potential for adult plasticity together with evidence of a relation in old age between regional cortical atrophy/shrinkage and increased activation in neuroimaging. Those cortical regions shown most consistently to shrink in adulthood--prefrontal and parietal cortices--are the same regions showing increased regional activation in aging. Combining several strands of behavioral and neuroimaging evidence, the author argues that functional plasticity alters the course of cognitive aging. The author advances the hypothesis that losses in regional brain integrity drive functional reorganization through changes in processing strategy and makes specific predictions from that hypothesis.

The aim of the present work is to verify the theoretical adequacy of the various scoring methods used to measure the Stroop effect. We present a systematic review of studies that have provided normative data for the {SCWT}. We referred to both electronic databases (i.e., {PubMed}, Scopus, Google Scholar) and citations. Our findings show that while several scoring methods have been reported in literature, none of the reviewed methods enables us to fully assess the Stroop effect. Furthermore, we discuss several normative scoring methods from the Italian panorama as reported in literature. We claim for an alternative scoring method which takes into consideration both speed and accuracy of the response. Finally, we underline the importance of assessing the performance in all Stroop Test conditions (word reading, color naming, named color-word).},

Explanations favor either bottom–up factors in early visual processing, or top–down factors near awareness. The {EEG} has a high temporal resolution, so event related potentials ({ERPs}) may help to throw light on these alternative explanations. However, the precise point in time of neural correlates of perceptual reversal is difficult to estimate. We developed a paradigm that overcomes this problem and found an early (120ms) occipital {ERP} signal correlated with endogenous perceptual reversal.

Proceeding from our time experiences of simultaneity, nonsimultaneity, temporal order, duration, and the subjective present, a classification of thresholds is established that marks distinct processes involved in time perception and the temporal control of movements. On the basis of this classification, evidence has been collected that suggests that perception and action share common timing mechanisms. Furthermore, brain structures involved in temporal aspects of behavior on different time scales have been identified–namely, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, and circumscribed cortical regions. Another question under debate concerns the representational mode in which time is represented in the brain; models suggest neuronal oscillations or interval-based mechanisms.},

In this study we wanted to find out whether subjective time perception could serve as a measure of cognitive workload during simulated car driving. Participants drove on a round course of a driving simulator consisting of three different environments with different levels of task demands. Drivers were required to perform a time-production task while driving the vehicle. Electrodermal activity and subjective ratings of mental workload ({SWAT}) were recorded simultaneously. The length of produced intervals increased significantly in more complex driving situations, as did electrodermal activity and subjective ratings of mental workload. Thus, time production is a valid indicator of cognitive involvement in simulated driving and could become a valid method to measure the current mental workload of car drivers in various traffic situations.},

The pupil response not only indicates mental activity in itself but shows that mental activity is closely correlated with problem difficulty, and that the size of the pupil increases with the difficulty of the problem. These findings relate to recent Russian research on the pupillary reflex in connection with orienting and brain stimulation.},

A total of 25 {RCTs} (123 datasets), 58,889 cases that received the {COVID}-19 vaccine and 46,638 controls who received placebo were included in the meta-analysis. In total, {mRNA}-based and adenovirus-vectored {COVID}-19 vaccines had 94.6\% (95\% {CI} 0.936–0.954) and 80.2\% (95\% {CI} 0.56–0.93) efficacy in phase {II}/{III} {RCTs}, respectively. Efficacy of the adenovirus-vectored vaccine after the first (97.6\%; 95\% {CI} 0.939–0.997) and second (98.2\%; 95\% {CI} 0.980–0.984) doses was the highest against receptor-binding domain ({RBD}) antigen after 3 weeks of injections. The {mRNA}-based vaccines had the highest level of side effects reported except for diarrhea and arthralgia. Aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines had the lowest systemic and local side effects between vaccines’ adjuvant or without adjuvant, except for injection site redness. The adenovirus-vectored and {mRNA}-based vaccines for {COVID}-19 showed the highest efficacy after first and second doses, respectively. The {mRNA}-based vaccines had higher side effects. Remarkably few experienced extreme adverse effects and all stimulated robust immune responses.},

	abstract = {Enhancing vaccine uptake is a critical public health challenge1. Overcoming vaccine hesitancy2,3 and failure to follow through on vaccination intentions3 requires effective communication strategies3,4. Here we present two sequential randomized controlled trials to test the effect of behavioural interventions on the uptake of {COVID}-19 vaccines. We designed text-based reminders that make vaccination salient and easy, and delivered them to participants drawn from a healthcare system one day (first randomized controlled trial) (n = 93,354 participants; clinicaltrials number {NCT}04800965) and eight days (second randomized controlled trial) (n = 67,092 individuals; clinicaltrials number {NCT}04801524) after they received a notification of vaccine eligibility. The first reminder boosted appointment and vaccination rates within the healthcare system by 6.07 (84\%) and 3.57 (26\%) percentage points, respectively; the second reminder increased those outcomes by 1.65 and 1.06 percentage points, respectively. The first reminder had a greater effect when it was designed to make participants feel ownership of the vaccine dose. However, we found no evidence that combining the first reminder with a video-based information intervention designed to address vaccine hesitancy heightened its effect. We performed online studies (n = 3,181 participants) to examine vaccination intentions, which revealed patterns that diverged from those of the first randomized controlled trial; this underscores the importance of pilot-testing interventions in the field. Our findings inform the design of behavioural nudges for promoting health decisions5, and highlight the value of making vaccination easy and inducing feelings of ownership over vaccines.},

	abstract = {Turmoil has engulfed psychological science. Causes and consequences of the reproducibility crisis are in dispute. With the hope of addressing some of its aspects, Bayesian methods are gaining increasing attention in psychological science. Some of their advantages, as opposed to the frequentist framework, are the ability to describe parameters in probabilistic terms and explicitly incorporate prior knowledge about them into the model. These issues are crucial in particular regarding the current debate about statistical significance. Bayesian methods are not necessarily the only remedy against incorrect interpretations or wrong conclusions, but there is an increasing agreement that they are one of the keys to avoid such fallacies. Nevertheless, its flexible nature is its power and weakness, for there is no agreement about what indices of “significance” should be computed or reported. This lack of a consensual index or guidelines, such as the frequentist p-value, further contributes to the unnecessary opacity that many non-familiar readers perceive in Bayesian statistics. Thus, this study describes and compares several Bayesian indices, provide intuitive visual representation of their “behavior” in relationship with common sources of variance such as sample size, magnitude of effects and also frequentist significance. The results contribute to the development of an intuitive understanding of the values that researchers report, allowing to draw sensible recommendations for Bayesian statistics description, critical for the standardization of scientific reporting.},

Moreover, the single item had a good convergent validity because it was highly and positively correlated with optimism, hope, self-esteem, positive affect, extraversion, and self-ratings of both physical and mental health. Furthermore, the divergent validity of the single item has been adequately demonstrated through its significant and negative correlations with anxiety, pessimism, negative affect, and insomnia. It was concluded that measuring happiness by a single item is reliable, valid, and viable in community surveys as well as in cross-cultural comparisons.},

The continued reign of the p-value is arguably due in part to a perceived lack of workable alternatives. In order to be workable, any alternative methodology must be (1) relevant: it has to address the practitioners’ research question, which –for better or for worse– most often concerns the test of a hypothesis, and less often concerns the estimation of a parameter; (2) available: it must have a concrete implementation for practitioners’ statistical workhorses such as the t-test, regression, and {ANOVA}; and (3) easy to use: methods that demand practitioners switch to the theoreticians’ programming tools will face an uphill struggle for adoption. The above desiderata are fulfilled by Harold Jeffreys’s Bayes factor methodology as implemented in the open-source software {JASP}.
